We accidently left some duty free shopping in the car on the way to the hotel, we rang the emergrncy number on the email and my bag of shopping was dropped off at the hotel the next day which we were very impressed with. On the way back to to airport our driver was 10 mins early which was great as so we're we. I would definately reccommend Airports Taxi Transfers to a friend and would use them again in the future. 

Thank you very much to both of our drivers, you were great."
1,Perfect!! Door to door service !!
2,On time both for collection and delivery. Although our plane were an hour late they were still there ready for us. Good job guys. Only slight negative...on the return trip the driver had no change...it was cash only....but we got it sorted between us. Thanks again

18,"I have used the service of Airports Taxi Transfers to get a transfer from Lausanne Palace to Geneva Airport on 13 July 2019. I have selected a 12 persons coach on their web site. 

We were a group of 7 persons with 9 big suitcases (80/84cm) as well as 7 cabin luggage. I have mentioned these details in my online request and this information was sent to the subcontractor. 
One day before the transfer, I was told by Airports Taxi Transfers that there will be 2 minivans instead of one 12 persons coach and that the subcontractor advised that the pick-up should be one hour before what I had planned because of expected traffic jams (Pick up 6:30am instead of 7:30 for a plane leaving in Geneva on Saturday 13 July at 10:40)
I have agreed for both proposed changes although I thought it was quite early. But since it was my first time in Lausane I did not know what the traffic would be like on a Saturday morning on the way to Geneva Airport. 

Then the next morning only one regular minivan showed up. There was not enough space for our luggage, and I had to ask the hotel to arrange another vehicle for us. On the way to the airport, the driver of the minivan naively told me that the earlier pick up was required to accommodate another fare he had after mine… 
I have paid for 396 EUR for a transfer in a minivan which cost usually half that price. 

Airports Taxi Transfers asked WhiteLine Transfers to refund me 198 EUR but the subcontractor declined, saying that they have done their job. 

Airports Taxi Transfers then wrote to me that they have stopped working with this company which has not even paid them their commission. I have contacted WhiteLine Transfers directly and they refuse to take any responsibility in providing a vehicle that did not match my needs and the price I have paid. 

Conclusion: Next time I will have to book an airport transfer I will do it through the hotel where I am staying. It might be a little expensive but at least hotels know the reliable local transports companies. (Cost of the lesson: 198 EUR)"
19,"Pick up was prompt, nice friendly driver spoke a little English but that was no problem, Nice clean car with lovely air conditioning, great service to the airport of Naples @€88 it was well worth the money"
20,"Great service, was waiting in the arrival area and trip went extremely well. Thank you 😊"
21,"We're very accommodating
Excellent service would recommend them to any one"
22,"Beautiful car, great driver and easy booking process. Highly recommended!"
23,"Had to wait around 20 mins for our driver on arrival in Tenerife airport.
Apart from that all good.
Would use again no problem."
24,Drivers were lovely and friendly.... Easy to use service and would definitely recommend. Only thing that I think should be mde clearer on website is when you pay driver you only pay 50% of total bill each way as our 1st driver took more and it caused confusion for the 2nd driver. Thanks
25,Excellent service! On time and efficient
26,Great service.on time and very clean cars
27,"Plane landed at Paris at 14:20, waited 50mins and no driver at prescribed meeting place. Made other arrangements. At 15:25 received a text stating my driver Maxime had arrived and where was I???? Not happy, wasted an hour - so did my friends waiting for me at the other end. Would not use again."
28,Very good service only fault was we had to wait 10 mins for the transfers when we arrived and on return journey we got dropped off at terminal 2 instead of terminal 1
29,"I used your service a few times. All the time when I arriving, I expect to see the driver, instead I have to look for the driver and make international phone call and only than he arrive to the meeting point or another point which he sends me because he can't get to the meeting point...."
30,Excellent service - highly recommended
31,Excellent and very helpful driver.Very impressive
32,"arrived on time, contacted the hotel room via reception to let us know he had arrived, driver was friendly & introduced himself. Vehicle was in good condition."
33,First time I have used them. Very good and professional in both directions. Helpful when I called to confirm pick up from resort (I didn't need to). Would definitely use again.
34,I was really impressed with both the ease of booking this taxi service and the quality of the drivers and the cars. I would definitely recommend the company and would use it again
35,"I chose their service simply because it was the first in my google search (I know, they paid for it). Turned out it was perfect - they provided me with the details of the driver one day in advance for my trip from CDG to Paris City centre, and Youssef was very responsive when I WhatsApped him. He was very friendly and took us to the hotel very efficiently. 

Based on my good experience with them, I booked the transfer to the airport with them again. However, this time was a bit disappointing cause they initially said the details of the driver would only be available a few hours prior to the pick up time (7:45 am) and that if anything happened I were to call their emergency hotline. Given the current strikes in Paris, I was nervous and it was after a few emails that I got the details finally. Thankfully the driver was there on time so all good. 

Definitely recommended"
36,"Was there waiting, and had a beautiful Mercedes van for our group and the driver was awesome. A great experience!"
37,Good service for a reasonable price.
38,"Alles super geklappt. Sehr pünklich, sauberes Auto netter Fahrer. Gerne wieder."
39,"Could not fault this transfer service except the drivers seemed to be very very busy all the time and as a result they drive very fast. Our driver from the airport said he was already late for his next pick up after ours because our flight was late getting in. He tore off out of the car park and was probably breaking the speed limit a lot of the time. The same happened on the pick up from the hotel, I have never been in a vehicle that traveled at that speed and if I was a person of nervous disposition I would have felt very uncomfortable. Drivers should not have to be rushing at speed to get to their next pick up. Otherwise I would recommend this company."
40,"We have had an extremely positive experience with this company. The driver was waiting for us at the airport and also he arrived 15 minutes earlier at our accommodation for the return transfer to the airport. Pietro was extremely courteous and offered to take our cases to the car.
The vehicle was a new, spotless and very comfortable Mercedes Vito.
We were travelling as a family and needed the extra space so this car was ideal. 
Very good value for money, we will definitely book again when in Rome."
41,Everything was perfect. I will use it in the future again.
42,Excellent service and punctual. Good value for money. Highly recommended.
43,"Excellent service, excellent driver."

51,"Easy booking process. Driver was waiting for us at the airport. Driver helped with our luggage, opened the door for us to get in, while he put the luggage in the vehicle. Driver was friendly, spoke good English and was very informative re the weather and different parts of the Island. Highly recommended. Would definitely use this company again."

55,"Our flight from N.Y. to Paris was 2.5 hours late, and we had a further delay on the ground at CDG to give the paramedics time to remove a passenger who became ill during the flight. However, our driver was waiting for us, exactly where I'd been told he would be. He was polite, personable and most importantly, calmly and expertly navigated the horrible traffic into and through the city. Our return trip to CDG from our hotel was also great--the driver was prompt and polite. I will definitely use this service again."

98,"My Worst nightmare!
On15/01-2020 I booked   with ATT Airport Taxi transfers,to be transported from Plaza Capri in Santo Domingo to las Americas Airport  to catch my flight to Norway via Atalanta.
Airports Taxi Transfers confirmed Reservation as Pending, with ref  AF923372916.
The next day I sent a mail to enquire the status og my booking, but only received the standard
automated reply  that my reservation was pending.
I called the number on their web site, but all in vain. The lokal number was rejected! As advised in thier mail that ""If  your transfer is within 24 hours and you have not received a confirmation please call us on +44 203 529 6710 to check the status of your booking""
I  called the above UK number, was put on hold for a long time til I gave up.

I was so desperate & had no choice, but to cancel my reservation.
I could not believe the reply to my cancellation.
They had the audacity of saying I quote:
""If we can be of any further assistance for future transfers please don't hesitate to contact us""
Me, to use them in future! no no NOT if I am in a sane state of mind  .
Anu Frølandshagen- Norway"

Our return journey to Faro, driver again arrived early, which was helpful. We were not quite ready and he was patient and helpful.

The driver (Jennie) picked us up from hotel on time and got us to the airport in about an half hour despite the heavy traffic in Athens. We were dropped off close to our airline location.

Shocking service. Will never use again.

175,"Easy to book, taxis on time and no issues. Maybe a bit expensive but didn't mind paying more for the service and the convenience"
176,"Very Poor service. Booked a taxi from Milan airport, the driver was not at the arrivals and i had to make several phone calls before he turned up 15 minutes later. I had paid for an upgraded limo but he turned up in a mini cab which was not at all comfortable. I had 2 bags and a coat which he did not offer to help me with and just rushed off when he eventually saw me. No water or anything in the cab despite it being quite hot and a 1 hour journey. Waste of time and money."
177,they were on time and very curteous
178,"The service was excellent, timing excellent and the drivers were very professional and friendly. The vehicle was perfect. Will use over and over again. Thank you for an excellent service."

182,"Very handy and quick to book, just the destination options arnt great"
183,"I booked a taxi for 5 people.
Our driver was waiting for us and he greeted us warmly with a big smile and helped us with our bags to the car. He was friendly without being intrusive and we enjoyed the journey to the hotel.
We will definitely use this service again and highly recommend this company."
184,Waited 20 mins at airport for collection could have got a bus or cab quicker. Had a 5 year old with us but still the driver was racing and weaving through traffic 👎
185,"A fantastic efficient company.
Thankyou ATC
I highly recommend them"
186,"Great service from a friendly driver despite it being 3am, arrived on time and got us to our destination smoothly, safely and ahead of schedule."
187,Excellent service -vehicle spotless. Driver very courteous and helpful. Only issue was the walk to the vehicle which was quite long and wouldn’t have been suitable for those less firm on their feet Still recommend them though
188,"After paying the quoted price they then requested another £120 or cancel the booking, i paid this and they then said they wanted another £20 to drop the group at two hotels half a mile apart.
Couldn't fault the drivers they were excellent but beware you are dealing with a booking agent not the taxi firm itself."
189,"Good service, delivered on their promise."
190,Have a discount of 20% is good for booking a return journey
191,We were left at the airport for over an hour with the promise that the taxi was coming. In the end two taxis turned up from another company and got us to the hotel over two hours later than scheduled. We were then contacted to be told we wouldn’t be getting collected to go back to the airport leaving us with the dilemma of arranging another transfer. Your company is absolutely useless and cannot be trusted to complete what should be a simple transfer that had been arranged in good time.
192,"All excellent but driver was late and I had to call him, but he was excellent especially with the cases."
193,"Very efficient service. 
Both drivers were on time and very helpful.
will definitely use Airport Transfer Services on my future visits to Barcelona."
194,"BY ACTUALLY PROVIDING THE SERVICE, WE WERE LEFT STRANDEDIN BENIDORM AND HAD TO CATCH 4 TAXIS DUE TO DRIVER NOT TURNING UP"
195,"Perfect, punctual, very helpful service.. l would recommend 100% TT.
Also a great price for the round trip from the airport to our destination, a fabulous house that was well hidden, way off the beaten track..."
196,Thank you for your service.
197,Amazing! Couldn't find the driver at the airport so rang up and they've told me where to meet up. Everything was well arranged. The taxi on way back arrived on time and dropped us off to the airport. Couldn't be happier with them. Great prices too! Thank you.
198,"Brilliant service, both drivers were on time and very pleasant. Given bottle of water for journey."
199,Excellent professional service and so reasonable
200,Very prompt with their pickups and polite staff.
201,"DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY IF YOU ARE GOING TO PARIS! The driver was 50 minutes late, made excuse Paris had strikes. 

The driver did not know where Disneyland Paris was? We googled the address for him, he then held my phone while driving, he cut up for 4 people and almost killed my entire family. He also answer a call to some woman while driving and looking at the other phone then later what looked like a gambling site putting bets on. All while driving and swerving. I even had to grab his steering wheel at one point as we was in the hard shoulder. 

The driver was shouting and scared my children age 4 and 5. 

This has to be the most dangerous taxi i have used in 35 years!"

215,Great service for a very reasonable price will use again thanks 👍
216,Great services
217,The transfer did not arrive. I had to wait 1 hour and 15 minutes for a driver to collect us from the airport. Once the taxi came we had to find them they did not come to the designated area of collection. I had paid an additional charge for a car seat and one did not arrive with the driver making it unsafe for my 6 month old baby. I would not recommend this company. Avoid at all costs.
218,Would definitely use again. Driver was pleasant and professional and got us from A to B with no issues.
219,Excellent!!!
220,Very well run. Excellent friendly drivers.
221,Anyone wishing to use this service will not be dissatisfied with either the standards of both the vehicles or the professional standards of the drivers excellent
222,Brilliant. On time. Driver looked very smart. Comfortable drive. will definitely use again.
223,"Outbound journey was great, but the return was a bit fearful! Driver was making phone calls, driving one handed whilst on the phone, and not fully concentrating on driving - this is illegal in the UK. He had the music loud and I had to ask him to turn it down. In my opinion his driving was dangerous, very close to the cars in front, maybe thats normal in france."
224,Excellent highly recommend
225,Excellent service. Only problem we had was when we arrived in Tenerife the driver wasn’t there and we thought this was due to flight being delayed and when we tried calling telephone number given this did not work. However driver did turn up and all was good.

258,Very efficient and polite. Apart from a slight disconnect at Geneva regarding meeting point we felt the service was top class and cheaper than Uber! On the return trip the road near the hotel was closed so the driver came to find us and carried our bags to where he’d left the car. Would use again.
259,Fantastic service. Easy to book on line and regular contact before pick up. Most importantly the drivers were excellent and coped with all that the Paris strikes could through at them. Particular praise for Julien whose knowledge of routes got us to airport on time.
260,Great service and would use again
261,"This is a great service, I will use Taxi service again.."
262,"If I could give ZERO Stars I would.
This company gave me a confirmed reservation with reservation number to take me and my family from Piazza Navona in Roma to FCO Airport.
The evening before the canceled the reservations.
Then they basically took an F-You attitude with me.
Well F-Them.
Use Uber, it's way more reliable.
This company should be ashamed of themselves.
Horrible customer service."
263,I booked this taxi service for a pickup from a cruise ending in Civitavecchia to Ciampino Airport. I was a bit nervous about being able to locate the driver in the port but everything went very smoothly. The taxi van had plenty of space and was comfortable and the driver was very pleasant and professional. The transfer takes about 90 minutes and the traffic was heavy but we were at the airport in plenty of time. I would not hesitate to recommend this service.
264,Great service both drivers were very friendly and on time
265,The service was perfect in every sense

Airports Taxi Transfers is cheap and good. Next time I will book again with this company."
271,Everything works As ordered and agreed. Recommend.

I highly recommend this service to anyone , we will not use anyone else again , they were brilliant A++++++"

281,"Driver was there on time (actually a few minutes early). Helped us with our cases and my wheelchair. We got a mini van to make sure the chair and all our luggage fitted in ok. It was spacious, clean and comfortable. The driver got us to the airport in good time and helped us unload all of our bags etc again. We booked this last minute as we weren't happy with the pick up time the holiday company were getting us at. We booked only 24 hours in advance, got our confirmation email almost immediately and that was us sorted! Fab service and I'd definitely use again"

On return transfer, I managed to contact the company one day before. The driver arrived at our house 15 min ahead of schedule. The ride was quite pleasant and smooth."
287,It would have been good to have air conditioning on our bus

292,Easy booking service and reliable drivers. Great start and finish to a journey

301,Second time used and would definately use again. Was there when arrived with card with name on and both times early for pick up. Courteous drivers and lovely comfy minibus
302,"Booked online, very simple and both inbound and outbound taxi was on time. Water available on both journeys which was also a nice little touch."
303,"Terrible experience in Milan. I booked this company after reading all the glowing reviews-especially about English-speaking drivers. We arrived in Milan Centrale train station and headed to the meeting point designated in an email-the ""middle of the arrivals near the farmacia"". On our way, I got a call on my mobile from the driver, who spoke very little english. I told him we were on the way to the meeting point and asked if he was there, and he said, ""taxis"" ""outside"". I tried to ask for more info, but he was useless and just repeated, ""taxis"". So, we went outside to the taxi rank and looked for him in the hot afternoon sun with all of our suitcases! After 20 minutes, I contacted the emergency number and told her what was happening. She confirmed the driver was OUTSIDE by one entrance near the farmacia, not inside where they said,. .We still couldn't find him outside (there are 2 entrances!), so we went to the Victoria's Secret kiosk and told her we would meet him there. After another 15 minutes, he finally showed up-an hour total of waiting/looking for him! This gave us an hour less to enjoy the evening in Lake Como, and running around in the heat was awful! We were going to schedule a return trip to Milan airport the following week, so I gave them a chance to make it up to us and give a discount on that, but they refused. We used City Airport Taxis, and they were terrific. She made the excuse that it was a colleague, not one of their drivers, and that the train station is ""difficult"". It would not be difficult if the driver waited by arrivals like they are supposed to instead of outside of one of the several entrances-or if they driver spoke English and could have told me over the phone where he was"
304,Great service on time and got us to our location safely
305,On time polite and clean car
306,Easy to book. Driver was waiting easy to identify. Very friendly and efficient service
307,"Unable to find the driver at Tenerife airport initially, wasn’t at the designated area, asked at all the areas and no one knew of the company, walked all through the airport, was about to get an ordinary taxi and then spotted the driver with the name placard, quite stressful. Fabulous service on the return journey, prompt pickup and driver friendly and exceptionally knowledgeable about the history of the area, would use the service again. The driver on the return journey deserves a bonus!"
308,"Very efficient booking process. Large and comfortable vehicle with an experienced, knowledgable and friendly driver. Very impressed."
309,"Very efficient, reliable and good price. I would highly recommend them and will use again."
310,Excellent! Already in the waiting lounge at airport on arrival and arrived 5 mins early for return pickup.
311,Peugeot not in same class as Mercedes or similar in your advert. Small point but it matters.
312,"Excellent, experienced and friendly driver, arrived timely, clean vehicle."
313,"excellent,on time,highly recommend"
314,"Matteo was absolutely lovely, very helpful, friendly and we were safe in the knowledge we could rely on him to pick us up at the end of our stay. We’ve had a bad airport transfer experience in the past so we really appreciate how important it is to have a nice helpful driver for a holiday taxi. He couldn’t have been more helpful. We went to France last year and dreaded going home the whole time and in the end had to contact the company to cancel so we could use someone else as the guy was so nasty. It caused us a lot of stress and it was just so refreshing not to have to stress about getting to and from the airport. He was early to pick us up and greeted us with a smile. We will definitely come back and will be using this service again. I would recommend anyone visiting Venice to get in touch with this company and ask for Matteo 😊"
315,I have used this service several times over the last several years. I have always gotten excellent service and excellent drivers. They have always been on time or just a few minutes early perfect extremely courteous extremely helpful. I will never use another service Anywhere in Europe. Just the best!

317,Excellent service. Pick-ups were on time and the driver was very helpful. Will definitely use this company again.
318,Excellent service provided at a great price. Driver waiting at meeting point with name clearly displayed on tablet. On the return leg the driver was there early and waited in the adjacent car park and arrived at the meeting point exactly on the dot. Both cars were good quality and very clean.
319,Das hat alles super geklappt. Sehr freundlicher service. Würde ich jederzeit wieder machen.

321,"Good value especially given the flight was over an hour late. 
Quick and efficient transfer."

327,"Absolutely perfect, no problems at all"
328,"Très bon service, toujours à l, heure. Je recommande."
329,Arrived 10 mins early. Mini-bus again. Steady drive to airport cannot fault the service provided
330,"Bearing in mind that we are not seasoned travellers ( this was to be a holiday of a lifetime to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary ) we decided to book a taxi for our transfer to accommodation from Toronto airport and pre-paid for service. Said taxi was to meet us in arrivals with a placard showing lead parties name. We went to arrivals and waited, after 10 minutes decided to go to pre-paid arrival services waiting area outside area of airport. Here we stood for 25 minutes with drivers getting out and asking for name to find this was not our taxi. Anxiety and stress levels were building !!! I then decided to turn my phone on ( I do not have roaming ) and make phone call to be met with ""you need to cross 2 roads and go to C24 and a vehicle would be with us shortly."" We went to C24 and waited no taxi. I then made another phone call ( bear in mind the cost of these calls ) and was told driver on his way. This waiting area was for hailing your own taxi, which we could have done ourselves !!! This is NOT THE SERVICE WE PAID FOR . A driver eventually turned up and took us to our accommodation.
I contacted airport taxi transfers to ensure that there would be a taxi for our return journey to airport at 5-20 am. We left our apartment at 5-15 am and waited in lobby for 5 minutes , we then proceeded outside to area where taxi's pick up and drop off and waited NO TAXI ( We have a plane to catch ) I then rang and driver said he couldn't find us and i explained we were at back of apartments in the designated pick up and
drop off area where we were dropped off before. We waited still no taxi, my husband then decided to walk around the whole of the apartments to see if he could find driver. He came back and still no sign of taxi. Another phone call and my phone ran out of credit, now no internet access to top up phone. At 5-55 am a taxi eventually came apologising profusely, he had gone to wrong address. !!! We were then whisked away at break neck speed to get to airport. I am hoping that i get some recompense for a disastrous and very stressful time that was to make our lives easy on arrival and departure !!!"
331,"Lovely car, and the driver was very nice pointing out places to us on the way"
332,Nice quick and easy process would highly recommend
333,"Booking and pickup went perfectly, even though our flight arrived an hour later than scheduled. They were obviously keeping a check on our flight, so knew we were late. The driver was very friendly and chatty. Will no doubt use this service again. Thanks very much!"

I would dedinately recommend

Booking process for the service was very easy, notification received with the driver information and contact number. This worked better on my trip into Paris, return trip to the airport the information provided about the driver and contract number where to a central office which wasn't helpful when you try and call the driver."
367,"Driver was waiting in arrivals, very friendly"
368,"Everything was as expected. A minor delay from the taxi driver at pick up time, but we phone through the contact phone and in a matter of minutes the driver showed up and took us safely, confortably and rapidly to our destination. Good service overall feedback."

The Savoy meet and greet before even landing in the UK . I am a mum of 3 travelling alone with 3 kids to the UK for a week. The driver was nowhere to be found even after waiting for an hour let alone and meet and greet. I called him as soon as got a UK tourist SIM from arrivals WH Smith and he took another 45 minutes to show up and started to scream at us so loudly to follow him to car park and to n my ale sure that we carry our baggage trolleys ourselves that the entire airport arrival area crowd was screaming at us in bewilderment.

400,"This was my first experience with “Airports Taxi Transfer”: Had to wait 10 minutes for the driver (would have been much more if our aircraft would have been on time). Explanation: The traffic is intense on Monday morning around Malpensa airport!! The driver was friendly. My experience might not be representative for “Airports Taxi Transfer”. However, since competition is important, will most probably try another service provider next time. Need a service I can trust since I do travel quit allot from Lugano to the world via Malpensa."

414,The meeting point was not as mentioned in the booking in front of Mark's and Spencer food at terminal one arrival. We were told by the call centre to carry our luggage and move to meet the driver at terminal 2 departure gate 16. That was most inconvenient and disappointing. Even though the driver arrived late at the new pick up point
415,"Excellent service would definitely use again.

Our driver was so friendly and helpful."
419,On time clean car's driver very informative good service all round
420,"The pick-up at the airport was great. Our flight was delayed but the driver was at the pick-up spot waiting. He was friendly and helpful. Excellent!

The return journey was not good, actually it was really stressful. We received a text the night before saying they needed to change our pick-up time to 10 minutes later. Although not happy about it, we agreed. However as the expression goes ""You give an inch, they take a mile""...… The driver finally turned up not the 10 minutes late, but 25 mins late and then we still had to load up all the cases. In all we finally set off for the airport about 30 mins later than we had originally booked. You just don't need this stress at the end of your holiday."
421,"I’ve used this service a number of times now and it’s excellent- reliable, bespoke to your needs and great value for money."

458,Had a couple of communication problems to start with which certainly put the driver under some pressure but he remained very pleasant throuigh the whole trip from the airport to my accomadation.
459,"Outbound transfer was smooth and efficient. The mix of car and water taxi for the journey could be potentially an issue however it worked well.

Our return journey was less smooth with the water taxi being 25min late. This caused unnecessary concern when catching a plane home. We had to ask our hotel concierge to call the company to ensure they were coming for us. The car driver for the second part of the journey did a good job of making time up."
460,It's a comfortable and excellent serviço.
461,"Great service but we paid extra for a 16 seater due to covid rules and an 8 seater vehicle picked us up , so no need for us to pay extra x"

Would definitely use this service again."
496,good service and on time.
497,"Excellent service. We used them from Rome airport to Rome centre. Driver was where he said he would be, helped with luggage, and chatted to us all the way in English, giving us tips for our time in Rome.
On our 2nd journey we were picked up from Civitavecchia cruise port terminal and taken to Rome airport. When we got off the ship the driver was waiting at the first exit next to the ship with a name card. So easy. He dropped us off right outside the entrance door to departures.
Excellent service throughout."
498,"I am normally a frugal person opting for public transportation but for a dream trip to Paris I splurged. It was THE BEST CHOICE I EVER MADE. not only that by booking a round trip I saved money, there was less stress I didn’t have to find the taxi. They greeted us at the gate and as we drove into Paris a commentary on his favorite parts of Paris. Pick up from the hotel was perfect such a smooth process! I’ll book again the next time"

507,Watch these people. They will try to double charge you. They claimed we were a no show and charged our card after the driver insisted on cash. As we have proof we paid we were able to get charge taken off our card. Unscrupulous and think you won’t try to dispute charges.
508,Exceptional service particularly from the driver taking us from the villa to the airport who couldn’t have done too much for us. He was extremely friendly and even took our suitcases into the airport to the check in desks. Would highly recommend using this service again! Stress free transfers to and from the airport!
509,"Overall I was impressed with the booking and the transport too and from the airport. The drivers were very good, helpful and courteous. The cleanliness of the vehicles were great, too. 
If I had one issue it was when we arrived at the agreed meeting place, the driver was not there, so we wasted about 10 minutes, picky I know, but if that's the service offered then it should be adhered to. 
You may also need to advise at booking whether you want to pay by cash or credit card as you may be charged extra to pay by card"

655,"We were going to hire a car and drive ourselves to the Amalfi coast, but were deterred by the narrow streets, parking, etc. Getting a taxi transfer was a great decision - the driver was pleasant and assisted with our bags and drove us as close as he could around the narrow, windy streets of Albori-Raito!"

Welcomming
Pleasent ride
Absolutely world class

665,"Excellent service , will use again!"
666,Be careful as they work with unreliable service providers. Booked car and children seats were not provided. Once reported to them they simply answered that their service provider did everything correct. What an attitude towards customers.....
667,"Airport Taxi Transfers are the most reliable, and best service we have used. Always punctual."
668,"Airport Taxi Transfers is an excellent service in every way. Booking is easy and efficient, vehicles were high standard and drivers were friendly and professional."
669,"We initially booked the taxi from Schiphol Airport to Eurocamp Duinrell in Wassenaar, Holland. The service was brilliant and the communication from the driver was faultless, he called just as we were getting the bags and told us exactly where to meet him, no problems whatsoever ever. Special mention to the driver Derya he made our transfer really easy and great looking after my family of 8 and showing us what to do and where to see things. We were so impressed that we booked your service to take us into Amsterdam sightseeing and again we had Derya. He showed us to where to go and where not to, and again we worked out to where to get picked up. We booked again to go back to the airport and again had the same driver. In some ways he made our holiday special and We can recommend the services very highly. So professional and the personality of Derya made or holiday special. Brilliant and would use the services again without hesitation. A1. Thanks"
670,We were very pleased with the service

681,Hi booked a return transfer from Paris Charles de Gaulle to Disneyland for 4 adults and 2 children. We ordered 2car seats for the children who were aged 5 and 2. Going to Disneyland was great but coming back to the airport was not. When the driver turned up we asked were the children’s seats were he said I will ring my boss then passed the phone to me. The boss then said if you didn’t set off now you could miss your flight.we managed to borrow a seat from the hotel for the 2 year old but the 5 year old had to sit on normal seat even though it’s against the law. Still waiting for refund of children’s car seats. Returned 29/02/20

690,Son muy puntuales llegan a la hora señalada
691,Excellent service from start to finish highly reccomended
692,"The service is one I would definitely use again. There were some minor gripes. WE were expecting one vehicle on our arrival transfers but ended up with 2. No prior notice of this led to some confusion. Then on our return transfer, the driver announced an hour into the journey that he needed to have a break for half an hour due to the number of miles on his tacometer. We had allowed enough time so thankfully it made no difference."
693,Easy to use and great service. So much easier than a shared transfer. Will definitely use again.
694,The taxi driver didn't wait for us...
695,great service !
696,The 2 transfers were Perfect

706,Great service - On time and efficient
707,"Prompt courteous service . No hold ups . On time . 
Perhaps a little chat /conversation would have been good but overall very very good ."
708,"If I could give this company 0 stars I would. I booked a taxi for 0945 on the 1st of November to go to Airport and paid in advance the day before. We sat waiting at the hotel reception and the taxi did not appear. I checked my emails and had received an email at 0951 (AFTER ARRANGED PICK UP TIME!) to inform us there was no driver and that we would be refunded and would take up to 10 days for money to appear in account. With fear of missing our flight, we had to arrange a taxi through the hotel reception, which was double the price. Very unprofessional, stressful and inconvenient experience. Do not book with this company! 

I called the company and they were very unhelpful."
709,Thank you for being on time and an excellent overall service.
710,"Arrived on time, very polite driver with a good sense of humor. He was being very flexible and patient when we asked him to take us to see some sights on the way to our hotel."

716,Efficient and prompt service on time in both directions. Competitively priced.
717,Both journeys were efficient and trouble free. Many thanks.
718,A seemless meet and greet at the airport and the driver was incredibly genuine and friendly. His knowledge of the local area was awesome too...felt like I had booked a tour rather than a transfer. Brilliant Service.
719,Amazing service. Highly recommended!

743,"*Avoid at all costs* arrived in Charles de Gaulle airport Paris with my pregnant wife an 2 young kids driver not there Waited for 20 mins before I proceeded to ring the number provided to be told in the most aggressive tone that he would be another 20 mins after which the guy hung up the phone, driver arrived 50 mins later walked passed us and beckoned us with his hand to follow him, got to the car which stunk of cigarette smoke and still had visible clouds of smoke bellowing out when we opened the doors, car was absolutely filthy inside, disgraceful service, would never use again."
744,Quick and easy to use. Booked on the morning before we arrived. Driver was waiting for name on board ready
745,"I booked two trips namely from Milan Malpensa to Bellagio (Como - Italy) and back.
The first trip was excellent and went as scheduled.
The return trip, despite taking place, was only possible from several contacts with the local operator and with some negative aspects:
The driver was not present at the scheduled time.
We had to call by phone to unblock the situation.
The car that was sent did not match the one you booked (mini van)."

The actual drivers were nice - but generally it was rubbish organisation."

Our driver was waiting for us in spite of a two hour delay in the flight and a long wait for our baggage.

The driver then walked off and left us stranded. 5 adults and 10 children. Contacted the ‘complaints department’ who can only be contacted by email, no phone number or address. And still waiting for a reply. Ignored several emails and ended several live chats since."

775,Very easy to book and reliable.
776,"Lovely friendly service. The vehicle on the way was a lovely Luxury Mini van but the driver didn’t speak any English so was difficult to communicate. However he got us to our hotel in great time and his driving was excellent. The vehicle on return wasn’t as nice, but was still good. The driver spoke good English and was very friendly and warm. Return journey was quick and he took us on the back roads to avoid traffic which was better was got to see some lovely french villages, and he explained where we were the entire journey. The communicate from the company is good, confirmed via email who the driver would be the day before, and receive a sms once they arrived. 
Overall great service and would use again and recommend to others 
Thanks to Jamel and Nazeem our drivers."

836,"Shame can't give zero stars as booked transfer and payment was taken immediately. However 1/2hr later email to say couldn't provide and would refund money, however 19 days later this still hasn't happened!!
With current technology they should know if they have no transport available and not take money for a service they cannot provide. Whilst issues do happen a refund should be immediate, same banking system that takes money that refunds so why not sort! 
My advise avoid and use a company that takes payment when they provide the service not before.
Tried their Live Chat and just takes question and asks for email address, so that doesn't work either:

Our team’s availability has changed and there’s no longer anyone available to chat. Send us a message instead and we’ll get back to you.

Just same as their payments then"

Amazing price for the distance ,it’s simply a prebooked paid for -shared taxi service split how ever many ways between you and who ever else happens to be going same way on the day/ time , you get there and when holiday over they are virtually waiting outside your hotel. No nonsense and will 100% use again if in Marbs❤️ Over all was better than a coach service as have to rifle through all luggage via coach. This was straight bags in the boot. ❤️"

939,"Both drivers from this service that we had were very unsafe and bad drivers. One in particular on the way back from Bellagio was accelerating towards bends on small mountainous roads, not looking at what was coming the other direction. He used his phone throughout the journey, undid his seatbelt at one point to grab something and overall seemed distracted. We felt so unsafe in his car we had to ask him to stop the car and slow down. It was an awful experience and we’ve never felt so unsafe in a car as we did with those transfers. Would NOT recommend this service."
940,The service was first rate. We liked the fact that we could pay the driver with cash on completion of the journey. He was there waiting for us on arrival even though our flight was delayed. A very pleasant man whose driving was excellent. All in we were very pleased.
941,Quite pricey but good transfer service overall. Drivers were on time and the cars were nice and comfortable.

952,"I booked for 10 person 11 bags 5 small bags 2 large baby strollers but was surprised that only one car arrived and fit half of the luggage and we had to wait with the baby and children for another car for more than half an hour .
On the return trip and because it was on 26 dec the disney hotel was busy so we could not bring the luggage on time because they had no one to pick the the baggage and the lifts were busy so when the driver called i told him that i am going to pay extra for the delay and I apologized , but i was shocked that the office called afterwards and talked to one 
Of the family not me and started shouting and yelling and asked for extra payment although I already told them that i will pay more 
I was so disappointed and dissatisfied with your company and I will never ever book again with such companies ."

957,Trustworthy operator
958,"We used Airport Taxi Transfers on 2nd December and was overall satisfied with the service, the driver didn’t speak very good English but this was not a problem and he was very polite. The only thing I would say that would of helped is that the driver waited outside by his vehicle and we were sat in the lobby of the hotel and didn’t realise he was there at first......maybe he could have just popped into the lobby and called our name to let us know he was there ! Would use the service again tho !"
959,"Our driver met us at the airport on time. Helped us with baggage and dropped us at the door of our accommodation. Likewise our return journey, driver was on time, helped with baggage and got us quickly and safely to our airport connection. Very happy with the service and will use again."

1044,"Booking process & cost were clearly explained. The drivers were friendly and courteous, cars were nice and clean. For the return journey to the airport, the company called my mobile the day before to ask if it would be OK to delay the pick up by 10mins as the driver's pick up schedule was a little tight and they didn't want me waiting and worrying, which I thought was sensible and helpful. The only negative was I had to wait for the driver at the airport for quite a while, but I could buy a Lisboa Card from the Tourist Info centre in the arrival hall while I was waiting so it was fine. All in all I was very happy with the service. I would definitely recommend the company."

1100,"I had a round trip, upon my arrival, I received a message with the driver details, pick up point and telephone number to call if there is any delay. I sent
a message as the driver was late, they answered immediately that he will be 
at the meeting point within a couple of minutes. He arrived as informed and all

the pick up was excellent and transport very good"
1186,"The booking staff were exceptionally helpful and patient in responding to my group's many questions about luggage size, scheduling, etc. Our driver arrived on time and took us safely to our destination. Our one suggestion would be for the driver to walk more slowly toward the vehicle as we almost lost sight of him as we followed him to the vehicle. Overall, a convenient, well-priced, professional service, which we would definitely use again. 
highly recommend them to and use them"
1187,"We used for 6 transports in 4 different countries. Every driver was early or on time, 5 vehicles had more than enough room and only one was a tight squeeze. In Venice I made a late request for an earlier pick up and the local company made it happen. All transfers, payments were seamless. We would highly recommend this company. 
As for cost compared To taxis, very reasonable and you knew the price, no haggling."
1188,"You don't know what to expect anymore with all this madness around. But I was pleasantly surprised to see such a good service on an beautiful yet not extremely developed island. Santorini is gorgeous but it has its areas that could look a little bit rough and deserted. But the looked after vehicle and the attentive and preventive driving made us feel safe ,from pick up to drop off. The driver wore mask the entire time and there was sanitizer at our disposal,in the van.
Great service, always on time,friendly and decent price,considering that everyone tries to gain back some of the huge money they've lost during the pandemic. I was expecting higher prices. I understand a taxi would cost about the same but in our case we didn't have to look for one outside the airport,or risk not finding a taxi due to high demand. They were expecting us with a card with our name,picked us up,drove away immediately and were at the hotel in no time.
I truly recommend them."
1189,"We have now used Airport Taxi Transfer all over the world. We have used them 5 times this year, the driver is always very pleasant and professional. Most importantly they are always on time, they get you to and from the airport safely and the process is so straight forward. Which ever country they are always waiting with a name card!"
1190,"Excellent service, any problems were promptly sorted by John a very helpful , calm and polite gentleman. The coach was prompt, lovely driver and everything went very smoothly, which was a great relief as 33 people all had planes to catch! Would definitely use them again and recommend them to others."
1191,"Excellent service! Driver and car on time, clean and reliable. Will definitely use again. Thank you"

I would definitely recommend and use this service again.

Thanks,

Christopher"

1198,From start to finish wonderful professional service will definitely use them again .
1199,"Excellent service, taxi driver was waiting on arrival to take us to our villa and arrived on time to take us back to the airport for our departure, highly recommend and reasonably priced, our villa was roughly 30-40 mins from Faro airport so for €84 round trip I thought was very good."
1200,"Amazing driver waiting for us at the airport and stopped throughout our transfers to allow us to get out to take pictures of the best spots of the island as well as providing us with history/facts of the island throughout our journey, we really appreciated this. Unfortunately the transfer back was not up to this service, firstly they turned up late and secondly the driver was constantly texting or voice noting inappropriate messages to his lady friend, not keeping his eyes on busy motorway roads or winding roads making us feel very uncomfortable the whole time! All in all I would use again and recommend as the first driver was the best airport transport I’ve ever experienced!"
1201,Excellent service - friendly driver ready in arrivals when we got there. Would definitely use again.
1202,"driver was friendly, on time and good service."

One negative...when I tried to ring to check where the driver was for pick up nobody answered the phone. 

(I rang on exactly the time the driver was due so he wasn’t late. )"
1207,"Excellent service. Easy booking, punctual attentive and very professional dřiver. We were a group of 6 and we travelled fronta Rome city center to Fiumicino AirPort. The car was very spacious. Definitely to recommend."
1208,Fabulous service would definitely recommend!
1209,Todo muy mal
1210,"Driver was late 20 minuts, considering i had a window of 90 minuts (60 transfer and 30 to spare) to catch my next train. So made it within 10 minuts and a lot of stress."
1211,"Walking through with our luggage looking at all the waiting drivers with their A4 sheets of paper with the name of the pick-up written in biro I had to get close to see if my name was on one of them. Then I saw my name in bold letters displayed on an iPad held by our driver.
Once in the taxi he confirmed our destination showing us a Google map route and photo of our accomodation. So professional."
1212,"Excellent, easy to book in advance, Communication with ATT very god., no messing about. Driver and vehicle both First Class. Will use again when next in Tenerife."
1213,"All was excellent, driver particularly was a superb driver and made a very comfortable drive through the Alps. Only gave 4 stars on this occasion as this was our first booking and I was expecting at least a text confirmation the day before to reassure me the ride was all set. Would have saved some minor anxiety knowing if the car was going to arrive for the early morning transfer. Please add this feature and it would be 5 stars without doubt. Most def will use service again!"
1214,"Excellent service, we got exactly what we paid for, collected and returned on time, and both drivers were very helpful and polite."
1215,Flawless service
1216,"Had no problems with my booking. Driver was waiting when we arrived at the airport and on our return the driver was outside the hotel waiting to pick us up. Highly recommend this service, very reliable!"
1217,"Our trip from Amsterdam airport to our hotel was really a mess! Based on our agreement we expected driver meet us at arrival terminal but unfortunetlly this was not the case! He called me and said that I need come to a meeting point far from arrival terminal an dhe sent us his location based on Google map!!!
With lagaues after us and several it was really unplasent situation!
Eventuelley we find each other and the car was old and unclean, on top of that the driver was not so helpfull and service minded to.
I sent an email to TT and they said that this time they used a contractor for transfering us and we will get 15% for next trip!
OK!?
I tried to order a new trip based on the dicount which I got for my unsetisifed transfer. They sent me a qoute which is 60% higher (146 Euro) than other compaines (Suntransfers.com 92 Euro) and when I sent them the offer I got they try to much the same price but no 15% discount is offered to me!

So, all in all I had very unpleasnet experiance with this company and I gave them the posibillity to fix it without any luck!

Me, it is last time I use this company for any transfer."
1218,1st time using this service and absolutely fantastic no problems at all communicated with me the whole time before each pick up cheers would recommend 100%

Our driver went out of his way to make our transfer comfortable, helped with our luggage, dropped us close to a lift and pointed us in the right direction ,he spoke very good English and was very pleasant."
1230,"Fantastic service..especially would like to thank the driver ( sorry I don't have his name) who did our round trip to the Hotelmuller starting on 5th Dec..he was professional,polite and and advised us 
of areas around munich that we might enjoy..a great start to our short stay"

Only issue was the vehicle used for the trip to the airport. Engine / Gearbox sounded like it was going to explode."

So we had to wait until he arrived which was quite a while. Not a good start!!😞. We asked the driver to make sure that the mini van would pick us up for the return journey to the airport! Guess what turned up, not a mini van, but a large car. Yes, the driver did get all the cases, but that is not the point l did not get what I paid for.😡"

1286,"The driver was reliable and punctual - most important!!!
Communication was difficult, spoke neither German nor English.

0,"Uber needs to make additional progress on safety issues. Be it for the driver as well as for the rideshare. I’m an occasional female Uber driver. I can say firsthand that driver safety is the last thing on their mind. I got a request to pick up Joe **. Once there I see 6 big built male passengers walking towards my vehicle. I rolled down the window and asked Joe ** to identify himself, and he does. He said Uber told them my vehicle can fit 6 people. My vehicle only fits 4 passengers! Uber Drivers have no idea how many passengers are being picked up. Uber should take measures to avoid possible dangerous situations."
1,"I've never had a problem with Uber until last night. I scheduled a ride last night and it cost $12.00. When I called for a pickup they told me it would be a while and that the price went from $12.00 to $40.00 because they were busy, what B.S. So I wheeled my friend and her wheelchair at night in the dark at 12 midnight through a bad area because no one was available to pick me up and I only had enough money for the original price of $12.00. Being a female with a disabled person in a wheelchair was a very dangerous situation. I really think Uber stinks because of this."
2,After an event the longer you wait to call Uber the cheaper it gets. Or if you walk away from the event to another place that is away from the event then call. They will almost always ask what kind of music you like.
3,"Uber is so inconsiderate. Pool at peak time costs 12$-14$ for 3 miles!! Maximum time is is so cumbersome to get a ride and on top of it very stingy to offer something nice. Does not uber strive for excellence and customer service? Good algorithm, good service and good deals for extensive using customers will be a business growth strategy. What’s going on??"
4,"I've been a Uber driver for a year as a contractor. I rate Uber management system and support team for the drivers. Uber makes the job so stressful for the drivers by its rating system, there's no investigation about the rating has had a logical reason or just a drunk or hallucinated passenger has made a false report of safety issue about a driver. I am a middle age lady with 30 years driving experience with no fine or any accident on my driving history, my driving account become deactivated by Uber because of false safety report. Uber charges passengers in a high fee rate but pays a little to drivers who has put their life and car in front line of various danger."
5,I took Uber in July and suddenly I receive a charge on my credit card October 26. They are billing people for June and July!!!! I received a receipt in July. How is this possible? The number on the credit card receipt for Uber isn’t a valid number.
6,"First time using Uber on a very busy NBA All Stars day in Charlotte, NC. We needed to get to the train station so decided to use Uber - the driver took a little while to get to us (no fault of his due to all the security all around) but once he found us he was very cordial - price was right - no complaints."
7,"Today we used the Uber app to try to get a ride to work for my daughter. After request, the phone rings and it is the requested driver informing us that because of the weather (winter in Michigan) it would cost us a surcharge of $20 because he had to switch from his car to his truck. I do not see how his switching vehicles becomes our financial burden. Uber needs to set limits on things and not allow their drivers to charge customers what they want. They already started charging more in general, now service charges before you even get a Uber. Sucks, this used to be a good service."
8,"My complaint turned out to be incorrect, and I am very sorry for that.  I had been fixed, and it was nothing that Uber had did. I was handled fast.  I have to give them a top rating for helping me to fix the issue.  I have used them many of times all over the US, and it has been perfect each time.  Thanks."
9,"This happened on 02/06/2020 - So the car I drive has been having some issues and I needed to drop it off at my local Burt Brothers. I didn't have a way to get back home so I thought I would use an Uber gift card I got from my work to help me get home. Oh, I WISH I had gone with Lyft. Issue number one - Uber's navigation decided to go out so I had to be ""Siri"" and guide my driver to my home (not a huge issue since it wasn't too far away). Issue number 2 - I go to give my driver a tip and rate him and again, Uber systems are down and acting crazy. Issue number 3 - For an 8.5-mile drive, I got charged $33.00 when it should have been $15.00 (thank GOD I used a gift card and not a debit card!)"
10,"Uber's customer service is horrific and nearly impossible to use when in need of solving something quickly - or at all. The lack of responsibility that this company takes with its clients is awful and if Lyft were in Mexico, I would use it instead. As such, I will never use Uber again. Uber needs better security for its riders against theft, especially in countries that have little to punishment for crimes."
11,"First ** time I called you, my drivers says, ""I can't make it. Cancel it. You wont be charged."" I cancelled it, I was charged. ** horse ** Richland, Miss. Jackson, Miss. area... He told me to cancel it. Like why did you take the job if you couldn't do it. Oh so you could make 5 dollars for doing nothing. Piece of **. Nissan Altima."
12,"How is it possible for Uber to auto sign me up for a 14.99 pass to ride once a month without any proof and my signing or clicking anywhere. I have tried to call the thieving company, have tried leaving bad reviews and hoping to get an email or a call. There are no phone numbers to get them or emails anywhere. I am now calling up my bank to return the charge and have disabled my app and will never never never use them again. What a crock or horse poop! Show my one strand of proof I signed up for this and how dare you charge me without me being able to call you."
13,Using this is convenient. I like the fact that sometimes when I don't want to drive I can use Uber to get where I need to go. The only thing I dislike is when you share rides you have to meet at a certain location and it confused the consumer so that could be straightened out. I think it would really help a lot of people when you're sharing rides and you're on a budget according to your financial status does. This would help improve when consumers and how they use Uber in the future.
14,"We ordered an Uber car to get to a concert. They said they would be there in four minutes. We received a text he was there. As we went out the driver called that his GSP took him to the wrong place. As we are waiting my friend gets a text the driver cancelled!!! As she was trying to see what happened to the money she had just paid she was charged for the cancellation!!! We didn’t cancel, the driver DID!!! Call a cab. It is quicker & CHEAPER!!!"
15,"I send for an Uber service and they gave me a price. After arrival, I ended up paying $25.00 more. This is the first time it has happen. I will never ride Uber again. People should know the final amount before accepting the service."
16,Thrifty for short trips when you have limited time and no car. Longer distances can be pricey and I generally like cheaper bus or rail if available. Or sometimes you can rent a car for a day for $15 or less.
17,"On Sunday I booked an Uber from Ghatkopar to Vasai at 9 pm. The Uber driver's name was Anand, white wagon R. He arrived on time. When he arrived he asked me where the drop was. I told him it was Vasai so he said he couldn’t travel that far because he stays in Panvel and needs to go home. I asked him why did he take the booking then he said he didn’t know the drop location. Then I was stern that I will not cancel the booking so he said that someone was unwell at his home so he had to go urgently (I know he was lying). "
18,"Uber's human customer service for riders is deliberately non-existent. The only service offered is via the app. There is no way to send email to Uber describing a problem. There is no way to send feedback to Uber except via the app, and then only tightly restricted responses are possible. I somewhat get it. There are countless millions of Uber riders, and Uber does not want to spend money reviewing random complaints. But I have found no way to provided feedback for a very serious problem."
19,"I linked my credit card to Uber for Epayment purpose but after my travel on 09/08/2018 Driver ask me to pay and I told him I linked my card. It will deduct from my card and driver said that, “I am not received money. Please pay cash,” hence I paid cash. Now again they deduct from my card also. When I contact help center of Uber they told that cash exchanged outside the Uber system cannot be recorded hence we cannot take account and cannot adjustment are refund."
20,Don’t use Uber. If you need a ride use Lyft. Uber has left me stuck in the middle of nowhere. I put $25 on my account and I can’t even use it. They locked my account for no reason at all. I can’t even get my money back. I try to email them and I get the same response over and over again. I will never use this crap anymore. Uber sucks.
21,"First off, the drivers are amazing. For one company to have so many positive and professional employees is amazing. However, I am certain that their awesomeness is not a result of the trickle down effect. I know this because, when it comes to Uber's corporate staff, customer service does not exist; literally! Their one flaw that I've observed in every driver is directly the daily of Uber executives. That flaw is poor GPS technology. Nearly every GPS app (including Waze and Lyft) is superior to Uber. This is a problem that would have been solved if the company had a customer service strategy and department worth mentioning."
22,"1st Trip on 31 December 2018 @ 16:30 - Trip Number: 2nd Trip on 1 January 2019 @ 03:00 - Trip Number: 1st Trip from home at 7 ** Street, Winchester Hills to ** Mount Street, Bryanston. Driver: Xolani Passengers: two Cost of Trip = R275. Trip cost was shown before accepting the Uber ride. 2nd Trip from ** Mount Street, Bryanston Driver: Peter Passengers: two Cost of Trip (Charged Twice) 1st Charge R863.00 2nd Charge R865.0 15 Minutes after arriving home, the R863.00 was reversed. Trip cost was not shown before accepting the Uber Ride."
23,"I gave a tip to a driver and he was almost very thankful, told me it is rare to get a tip because Uber does not encourage it. Most everyone should be encourage to tip if the service is provided."
24,My issue with Uber is they quote you a price when you complete your trip and days later the price is different. They don't tell you anything. I started using one card just for them that is how I found out and if you check your receipt it's says wait time or toll surcharge and fees. This is robbery and they need to stop. The drivers are saying they arrive and most of the time they are in the wrong place or they drop you off in the wrong place and pretend they did not hear you say no it's over there. That's stealing.
25,Your diver was not professional. He came very late for pick up. He took 15 minutes for 3 kilometers and he is not ready to understand my problem. I face very bad experience. Early morning empty roads of Chandigarh he took 15 minutes. OMG. 6:30am I did my booking. 6:45 he came to pick me up. It is hardly 2 minutes distance. From driver location to my pick point location. It was madness that I trust on your company and your professional drivers.
26,Far too overpriced. A ride of less than 10 miles is more than $25. I live in the 5th largest city in America so not sure if this posts a part? This is my biggest reason for not utilizing the service more.
27,"I’m a Uber Driver. I got a request on my app, I picked my passenger from Brooklyn, NY to Union City NJ and I paid the tolls. After I dropped off the passenger to the same address I have on my app I received a message from Uber that my fare been adjusted to $ 0.00 because it was a wrong rider (by the way it was same name, pick up & drop off location). What should I do next time? Take a copy of the rider ID. EVEN THE TOLLS I PAID FROM MY POCKET. IS THAT FAIR?"
28,I’m going on day two of being an Uber driver and I hate it. Uber pays you less to do long distance drives and they don’t follow through with their promises. Before I get into that my biggest complaint is the navigation system. It’s inaccurate and very slow. They try to blame your phone service but if it were my service then my maps on my phone or the Waze app (which is what I use on the daily) would glitch out as well.
29,Uber has been ripping its drivers off and need a class action lawsuit against them for doing so on several occasions. I've reached out to them about trips I completed with them and never got paid for. I completed a delivery and was not paid for doing so on several occasions and the customer service sucks and require us to email them to get help. They ask you to wait 24/48 hours to be paid but they never pay you.
30,If I could give no stars- I would. UBER and customer support a zero. UBER charged more than what I was quoted. The map Uber gives their driver from the pier to Long Beach Airport was wrong. No airplanes in site following the UBER directions. We were going in circles. I finally pulled out my maps TO direct driver to correct location. Obviously UBER directs their drivers to the wrong location all the time. The address is a commercial business not LONG BEACH AIRPORT. The business made a commercial sign to tell UBER drivers this is not the LONG BEACH AIRPORT.??? It appears UBER is charging me an additional fare to go around in circles. It's a good thing I requested a ride hours before my flight. And all the agents in customer support are donkeys. How hard is it to understand what I just said. They have not adjusted my fare.
31,My daughter's Uber account was hacked and you cannot find a single number or chat to have a conversation with Uber directly anywhere. Uber appears unreachable unless you have a safety issue with a driver...otherwise they appear completely unreachable by design.
32,"My first experience did not go well. I’m in Waikiki and needed a ride from a hotel to a restaurant for a scheduled luncheon. The app worked well and the driver was to arrive in 3 minutes. There were pick-up time adjustments as the 3 minutes passed and 15 minutes elapsed. We are now late for the luncheon when a text is received from the driver that he cancelled our ride. A new Uber request is sent and a driver dispatched with a, ""be there in 3 minutes."" No Uber after 6 minutes; however, the driver telephoned to indicate she was lost but should arrive soon. We stayed in touch by phone discussing her locations location as updates were provide. The car finally arrived and on our way to the luncheon arriving 50 minutes late. My return to the hotel from the restaurant went well."
33,Disgustingly poor customer service. Responses in the app seem to come from robots because I received the same response 5 TIMES to my initial inquiry and follow up responses. It seems like there are no humans that actually write back to you. I tried to get help from their support account Twitter handle but of course it was disgustingly unhelpful as well where I was told to just keep going back and forth with these robots responding in the app. I guess I’m never going to get my issues resolved which means I’m losing money. Despicable way to treat customers.
34,"INCORRECT trip. I've sent many proofs to confirm this wasn't my trip. The pickup was ** to 59 Canal. Driver was stuck in traffic downtown Brooklyn by the Barclay, my son missed his 9 pm bus to go back to school, so I canceled the trip. The driver tried to extort my then 17 yr old son for cash to bring him back. I spoke to her on the phone. She told me to order another car so she can intercept it, I said ok. She then changed her mind and kicked my son out in the middle of nowhere downtown BK. ANYTHING COULD'VE HAPPENED TO MY SON! Now I'm stuck with this bill after I paid what I owed on top of that. I've tried to resolve this many times but, to no avail. And the driver reported a bogus trip."
35,"Driver was lost and could not speak any English. I was going to my first job and it was my first day. I got there a half hour late. Driver made me feel very uneasy. I tried to call Uber customer service, it was very difficult for me to find their phone number. When I finally found their number and called them it took over 10 minutes to get someone on the line that could help me."
36,"The booking fee is a phony ploy to enhance the total bill. It is a tactic used by unscrupulous cell phone providers and wifi providers. My experiences with Uber have been very positive but I really resent the cheap shot of adding a ""booking fee."" It is completely unnecessary, and uncalled for."
37,"My husband took an Uber from our job to come home, our job is one mile away and he was charged $11 dollars when it used to be $6. I’m so upset, I tried to get in touch with someone in Uber but you can’t. I don’t think is fair that they eat way with this."
38,"This company should be out of business... I returned to Uber after 1 1/2 years just to make a little money to pay a bill. I drover March 9 and 10 for about a 1 each day. I made $68.27. I needed the money fast to pay a bill on Monday March 11, I tried to cash out and they stop me from cashing out... They kept saying something was wrong with my bank information... How can that be when I've had the same bank information for over 5 years and the same as when I drove for them a year and a half ago."
39,I requested an Uber in London (as a tourist) to the airport. The driver missed the exit because he was distracted with his phone. We arrived 45 minutes late and were charged for the whole trip. I requested a refund but was only given Uber credits in £ to use in the UK. We don't live in the UK so we can't use them. I asked several times for the refund but they say they can't do more than give me credit.
40,Worst customer service. In Uber initial fare shown only rs. 45 after ride completes it shown as rs. 90 double the charge. So I trying to customer service but all numbers not reachable. Very worst service.
41,I placed an order on Uber Eats and the food never showed up but I was charged anyways. I called to tell the customer service reps but they ignored me. The food never showed up and now I can't eat my lunch because I gave my last money to eat today. This is completely unfair that my food never shows up and I still got charged! I want my 13 dollars back!
42,"So, it had been a while since I visited New York City. At LaGuardia Airport I wanted a cab to get to my destination in Brooklyn and the Yellow Cab drivers refused to take me. I had truly forgotten how racist the Yellow cab drivers were in NYC. BUT! Thank GOODNESS for Uber! Downloaded the app, got my ride and used Uber my entire stay in NYC. TO HELL WITH THE YELLOW CABS! UBER IS THE GREATEST!"
43,"Booked pickup. Driver went to wrong pickup point. Tried to reach Uber via phone. Did not recognize my phone number which is the correct number on account. Called twenty times. You can not get through as recording says that number is incorrect. Driver did not attempt to call me which he should have. Was charged cancellation fee plus ride. This is a system that has clearly failed. Initially appears to work but no transparency and no way of really getting through. Discount promised. Didn't see it. Emailed back after receiving receipt. Response from Uber: ""This email is not monitored."". I was a horrible experience not to be repeated. Unfortunately I won't use Uber again. Take a cab."
44,I have been driving for Uber for 4 weeks (to earn a extra money on weekends). After 3 weeks of not receiving my pay and numerous contacts to Uber partner help - I have received a customer service message that “due to security issue with my account” I must contact and reinput my banking information.” Which of course I did through the app from my iPad. The message was again that I had security issues. 
45,I use tons of apps daily and I've never seen such bad service from the Uber support team. They have stalled for weeks not accepting payment while every other app in my phone is working perfectly. They do not provide solutions and seem to be on permanent lunch break. I spend roughly $6000 a year on them and you'd think they would try to help. They simply don't care and ignore me. What a way to treat good paying customers in 2020. :)
46,Uber is the worst service provider ever. I booked a cab from Yeshwantput to Marathalli which cost 320-350 RS. The driver stopped the cab after few min in a highway and said he cannot go any further as the mode of payment was online and he doesn't have the money to put petrol. The trip cost me 80 RS and after then when I booked another cab I had to pay 550 so in total I had to pay more than 600 rs. I want to know who will pay the extra charge that I had to bear.
47,"I ordered an Uber around midnight, it said it was going to take 9 minutes so I waited, left the club with 1 min to spare, saw the car pull up, got in, only to be told the taxi wasn't for me - he hadn't even asked my name!. He said he wasn't taking me and to get out and drove away. I looked at my phone and it came up driver has cancelled. My original ride was going to cost £20. I tried to book another Uber and the price had been upped to £40-50!! I had to go home late at night on the tube with a walk at the other end which I didn't feel comfortable with. "
48,I am so upset with Uber service. After booking the driver asks where to go. If it is not convenient he cancels the ride. And it is too tough to get a ride. One has to wait for such a long time. Worst service.
49,"Uber drivers see my name and cancel rides all the time. I am a ** female. I don’t have a criminal background and I worked for Uber for some time about a year ago until I sold everything and moved to another city to continue my education. I have had rides cancel on me while I’m waiting for them to arrive. After Uber says they are en route to me. Here is where it gets really crazy. On top of that Uber charged me each time 5.00 for a cancellation fee. That the drivers canceled on me. I really read all about statistics showing that drivers are 4 time more likely to cancel rides with a person with a name that sounds like an ** name and so forth so I know this is the case. However, I find this so disheartening that Uber who knows it is people of all races keeping this business thriving is allowing this and topping it off with charging a 5.00 cancellation fee after you have been discriminated against. "
50,"My wife and daughter spent a couple of days in Belfast. They decided to use Uber on the 1st day. Hotel Etap to Primark, journey is roughly 1 mile and had the cheek to charge them £14. This is someone taking advantage of 2 women on a break. It took them 10 minutes to walk back to the hotel. Didn't even want to leave the 1 star but you can't give them zero. This behaviour is disgusting."
51,"I had a confirmed ride from Seaford NY to JFK, scheduled and confirmed the day before and morning of my ride. I saw the driver come onto the APP 20 minutes before my pickup. At exactly one minute before my ride was to arrive, I got a message they cancelled my ride, and saw my driver 30 minutes in the opposite direction. Every time I called the cell #, I got a Spanish recording. Uber was 100% unacceptable for leaving me stranded with no ride to the airport with no apology or excuse. I will never use them again, and LYFT is now getting all my business. I shared this story with everyone I know. I was not surprised to see their stock price falling and business tanking. That was deplorable customer service."
52,"Spent way too much time today setting up our Uber for Business account since several folks from our company are going to be traveling. Sounded like a great concept but after getting everything set up I was informed that they needed three days to process our account. Nowhere was there a mention of that and we've used Uber individually for a long time. So, tried to get some help and they just weren't too concerned or interested in trying to resolve the issue. So account is deactivated and we use another provider who seems to care a lot more about customer service. Just a warning..."
53,This is the first time I use Uber. I had no clue on how to use the app. Made the mistake of ordering service hours before I needed it. Uber sent two drivers. I was able to get the first before she got to my house and cancel without being charged. The second driver had no phone so I got charged for a canceling fee because he came to my house. There is no number for customers to call for help. All they have for customers is a frigging automated machine. Never using Uber again!!!
54,The most cunning app I have found so far. I took an Uber lets on Friday. It cost me 34.00 And then next day I requested for Uber the app says I have pending transaction even though I had money on my account. I requested for Lyft. I was able to reach my destination. Spoiler alert get your ** straight Uber. Call me **.
55,"Uber is not only an excellent service, it has been for me one of the most important service I can’t live without it, practical and all my experiences up to today very good, with very kind and respectful drivers."
56,"I'm going to share a story about why I will never use Uber again. A month ago, my Uber account was hacked. In fact, AMEX confirmed to me that they had SEVERAL people calling in to say their Uber accounts had been hacked that week. Nothing on the media - strange? Within a 4 day window, 118 rides were charged to my credit card in USD - each totaling over $120+ CAD... Resulting in $8,200 of wrongful charges to my AMEX (thankfully I have fraud protection on my CC, so it was on Uber's end to stop the charges). Even though I alerted Uber immediately when it happened, it took them 4 DAYS to STOP the charges from being incurred/charged to my card."
57,"Venmo sent me an email with a code for $10 off an Uber ride as a celebration for being able to use them as a payment method. I applied the code to my account, took a ride, the code didn't apply. I asked Uber support why and they said I had to make sure payment was on Venmo. Alright. I took another ride and made sure Venmo was my payment, still nothing. Contacted Uber support over 7 times and got answers ranging from, ""we don't know what ride you're talkkng about"", to ""select your payment method to apply credit"" to ""This code expired"", ""We're unable to refund or credit this ride"". Basically, they refuse the email fine print from Venmo and don't care that there was a promo code that was supposed to work on their platform. Very poor service."
58,"I was a frequent Uber customer, however after today I am so disgusted and disappointed to say the least with Uber. Long story short I typically take an Uber with my daughter when I am running late. Typically the ride is only 8.50 on average when it is raining the price goes up to about $12.50 as expected. I took an Uber this morning and I had a small spill of my coffee in the rubber carpet floor. I immediately told the driver and apologized as I was trying to put a seat belt in my daughter. He passed me one napkin and I tried to wipe it as best as possible."
59,Requested Uber to come to pick me up. The driver never showed up but they charged me cancelation fee! Scumbags! The driver never answered the phone. They just sent me the bill for cancelation! I didn't cancel it! UBER DID but they charged me regardless. AVOID LIKE PLAGUE!
60,Uber put my account on a 48 hour hold because I added new info to my account. Uber has not yet paid me my money. Feels like they are trying to hold on to it and not give it to me. Uber does not care about their drivers at all. Uber always feels the customer is right which is not the truth at all. Uber needs to get it together something serious.
61,My account was hacked and the hacker did rides fraud and charged 800 soles and Uber when I reported charged it too. My credit card 800 soles and after all the proof provided by me they agreed to give the money back and they mistakenly send it some unknown account not owned by me even though I reminded them my right account and now when I updated all my information they asked for dragging for 2 months and now when I was upset they decided not to return my money and block my account. Great way of robbing.
62,Uber allow only drivers who been approved thru their background check and follow all community guidelines which allows passengers to be feel free with ride Uber partnerships so both drivers and passengers comfortably taking care their business.
63,Made a great friendship from my first ride to my appt! She was so respectful and I could talk to her about anything! I could put my trust in. I miss her so much! She always was there when I needed her! Now I have moved back to Illinois and miss the rides and talks we shared! I hope someday I can get a ride from her and talk again soon! Your friend Mary.
64,"I do not drive. Mostly I walk. Since I fractured a bone in my foot, though, I haven’t been able to walk, not even to a train station or bus stop. I have been utilizing Uber and it has been a godsend - the drivers are polite, the cars new and sometimes even fancy. Other than a few navigational mistakes, my experience with Uber has been great. Gets a little pricey, though. Can’t wait to have my foot back!"
65,"We’re driving on White School Rd Sevierville 2:30, 4/8/19. Driver whipped around us splashing puddles of water everywhere. He was speeding. It was raining, and it was downright scary. A School bus was en route and this road has many curves. The UBER driver was unsafe and a danger to us, school children and everyone else on the road. I found it disturbing that nobody from UBER can be reached by phone, text or email. I think there is enough detail in my review. People need to be able to CONTACT CUSTOMER SERVICE REPS. I tried and got redirected to everything but the tooth fairy... TRY CALLING UBER TO REPORT A COMPLAINT FOLKS... Let me know what website you're redirected to."
66,"My initial issue with Uber started back in August 2018. My first attempt at opening an account was on August 2nd after attending a concert with my friend. Keep in mind, this was the FIRST time I have ever opened (or at least tried to open) an Uber account. After I provided the necessary information, I was given a big red error message saying that my account had been disabled. How my account had been disabled even though I never opened an account is beyond me. At any rate, I figured I'd go to the website they provided to reactivate my account. As I'm trying to do that, the request wasn't going through. After multiple attempts I gave up, and I had my friend download it and we were able to get home. "
67,"I ordered an Uber and the driver was very nice so I tipped him atter. I kept getting error messages while trying to tip saying that it wasn't going through. I waited a few minutes, tried again, and success. The next day I checked my bank account and saw that I was charged the tip twice. I messaged customer service and they credited the money to my Uber account. I wanted a refund because I rarely use Uber and I just wanted my money because I only authorized a one time tip. After many back and forth messages they still refused to refund my money. I will never use Uber again."
68,"I have had to cancel 2 credit cards because of multiple & repeated fraudulent charges by ""Uber Technologies"". While the the credit card company reversed the charges, I'm still put through the hassle of changing everything tied to the cards. The credit card company also advised me to contact Uber to complain, but Uber has NO CONSUMER SERVICE, NO EMAIL & NO TELEPHONE NUMBER to report this - unless you sign up with Uber & create an account (giving them credit card & personal info). There is no way I'm going to do that."
69,"Never had a dirty or unsafe car. Some drivers are more personal than others, but I have always felt safe and they have always been prompt and direct in their routes. Some of them have really nice cars too!"
70,Both of my Uber drivers were prompt. The conversation was great! They made my ride very pleasant and enjoyable. Also my car was down at the time and they were a big help!
71,No problems gate codes or other info they need when getting the ride as long as I check what the app says my location is versus just pinpointing through app. Can always send note to driver to correct or clarify location.
72,"On January 18, 2020, I made a ½ hour trip with Uber near Quito, Ecuador. The agreed fee was $ 8.95. The same night, Uber charged me $71.58 on my Visa card. The email receipt showed a map with a trip I did not take. It appears that my driver, Franklin **, continued driving and charged me for the extra trip. When I contacted Uber (submitting all the details as requested in the app), they deleted my account, saying they had detected some irregularities. I have been trying for days to resolve this issue, including attempts to reactivate my account, but the app won’t let me. I continue to get the same automated responses by email, directing me to use the app (which I can't do). There is no phone number, so I have no recourse to getting a refund. Although in this case it appears the driver was fraudulent, it is unacceptable that Uber provides no method for resolving the issue. BEWARE OF UBER. I will probably never use them again."
73,On Thursday 27/06/19 I lost my wallet with a significant amount of cash and important identity cards and ATMs. Tried to call Uber. There are no customer helplines. Uber allows to connect to drivers but the driver had picked other rides and so that leaves me knowing that the next rider might have taken up the wallet but I can't do anything about it.
74,"I loved Uber from the start. Until my recent experience trying get an issue resolved through their customer service team. I have since decided to part ways from Uber. I have never had issue or pay disputes or bad reviews with any uber. I believe when I bought my new phone (new number) and downloaded the uber app on this new phone, somehow my payment method was blacklisted from uber and my uber app privileges revoked. Keep in mind there is really is no help or support after you been flagged by this. I am extremely disappointed the by the way their tech team gave me vague response and lack of resolution to my situation. If this is the way they treat faithful customers I want no part of building their business."
75,"I used to absolutely love Uber and took daily trips to and from but I swear this year both Uber and Lyft's prices have skyrocket. Even riding pool has gone up tremendously. It's crazy that people have now decided to pay co workers weekly to carpool with them rather than get an Uber. More people are going to go back to trains and buses in order to save money to get to and from work. Either that, or go ahead and get a car because you'll end up paying a car payment anyway riding daily with this company if not more."
76,"In June, I ordered an Uber car to pick someone up at Marseilles Train Station and bring them to an address that was one hour away. The screenshot of their quote showed that the cost would be between 192 and 254 Euros. There was absolutely no mention of a surcharge. They then charged me 471.02 Euros ($742.47 CA) saying the ride was at a high traffic time. It was 10:30 pm at an almost deserted train station. "
77,It always shows as 5 min for arrival before booking the cab. As soon you I book the cab it takes 15-20 mins for the arrival. It still shows 12 mins arrival. You will not get to cancel the ride even because they charge cancellation fee for that. Always it has been a Worst experience.
78,"I ordered myself for a ride about 10 blocks away from my home to a restaurant knowing I would be consuming alcohol. They offered me a discounted ride to walk to the corner of my block for pickup. I agreed to that. Once I confirmed my ride, I was notified I would be dropped off about 4 blocks away from the restaurant. I never agreed to that. That part was not advertised. That area is unsafe being is next to a highway ramp with no crosswalks or traffic signals to get to my destination. So I immediately canceled the ride. "
79,"I haven't used Uber in a couple of years. I was recently asked by my employer to activate Uber for business and link my personal account. The last time I attempted to log in to the Uber app, it wouldn't accept my password. I attempted to reset it, but never received the verification texts they sent me so I could not. I have since gotten new phone number and so I had no way to receive their verification texts. I contacted customer service and they responded with a generic reply asking for the same information I sent them in the help form. I replied giving them this information again and explaining that I could not get the verification texts so I could not reset my password. They asked me to provide a screenshot of the phone number on my phone, which I did, and then they replied saying it didn't match their records. Of course it didn't match their records! I already told them that. "
80,"In my most recent requests for an Uber Ride here in April 2019, I was quoted a price on the app, and the final charge to my card was nearly twice the amount. I was completely shocked, felt deceived, and was completely blindsided. Their advertisement stating that you will know your price before requesting your ride is not true and misleading. Additionally, I was charged a “wait fee” on these requests. How can I be charged a wait fee when I was standing at the curb when the driver pulled up? I will no longer use Uber for a ride, and will give my business to Lyft."
81,"I was charged extra for waiting period for just 5-10 mins. for a genuine reason. Are you giving us discount when your driver gets late. It's not about charges I paid, it's about justness. Either don't charge for it up to 10mins. Yo"
82,I had a problem with a driver cancelling and being stranded on the street corner with no ride. I asked support if there was any way to schedule rides so I didn't experience cancellations among other concerns. I got a form letter response saying that the $5.00 I was charged for not getting a ride had been refunded (I already knew that). The email for Uber customer service does not allow for two-way communication. I guess Uber can provide nothing and call it customer service anyway.
83,"I have driven with Lyft for quite some time and I have a 5 star driver rating. I say that to clarify it's not me. I have been trying to sign up to drive with Uber quite unsuccessfully for the better part of year. With two separate accounts even. Both times with both accounts after passing background checks and all other necessary REQUIREMENTS they have held me up each time because they claim I am submitting a profile picture that isn't visible. I have submitted photo after photo after photo after photo, some of which were currently being used and or accepted by Lyft and Hyre. So it cannot be possible that these photos are anything other than exactly what is requested."
84,We have used UBER near our home in Arizona with excellent results. Less costly than taxis and much easier to use. We also recently used UBER quite a bit in France. The service was much better than taxis or car services. Clean cars that show up on time and know where they are going (even when we didn't).
85,"Uber only has online assistance/customer service, that's the first issue. The second issue is their online help never addresses the issue. All I wanted was a password reset. It's been over a year since I used their service because of an issue with a driver. I don't have the old phone to send a screenshot, I don't remember my last 2 trips, only one trip. My email and name should be sufficient and the fact I remember the last one last trip. Then if all of this isn't bad enough it takes them forever to respond, if at all. They have an office in Chicago and for what? Because they are apparently of no use either."
86,"I strongly encourage any Uber customer to take a screenshot of each part of your transaction as you order and ride. It may be a little tedious but I'm sick of arriving at my destination and seeing an upcharge on the ride and/or the tip. If I type in that I want to authorize a tip of $10, I don't want to see $10.25 on my receipt. If Uber chooses to be greedy by giving the driver $9.75 and keeping the $0.25 for whatever reason, that's a choice Uber makes. Screenshot each part of your transaction."
87,Rideshare is one of the greatest innovations of our time. It's convenient and helpful to a large number of people. I have concerns about safety for the drivers as well as the passengers. The navigation also needs a lot of improvement.
88,"I used Uber almost exclusively to ride to DEN airport as well as other locations in the US and abroad since 2015. I recently noticed a change in the way Uber quotes prices. It used to be that the price quoted was the total price for the trip. In recent rides the price quoted excludes booking fee, airport pickup/Drop-off Fee which totaled in $10 more than the quoted price. This is a deceiving practice. I will be transferring my business to Uber's competitors. In a recent Uber ride the driver started to charge wait time as soon as he arrived at the pick up location, even though he saw us taking our luggage out."
89,"While traveling Europe I spent over 500 Euro with Uber. They overcharged me on 25% of the trips I made compared to the quoted price given on phone app, after the ride was completed. One instance they quoted me 40 to 50 Euro and charged me 70 Euro! Over a 100 Euros were spent from overcharges compared to their quoted phone app price. This seems very dishonest to me."
90,"I have contacted Uber 8 times over 2 months about a driver that STILL HAS my phone to this day. Their answer, long story short? Deal with it, not our problem. It's incredible for a company this huge to provide such horrible customer service. There's no number you can call them to in Australia. Literally no way you can TALK to one of their customer service staff. Each and every single time I opened a helped ticket, it was closed before the issue was resolved, making it impossible for me to contact whoever I talked to before, and making me go through all the steps to contact them once again. Never using Uber again."
91,"Overall I am very satisfied with the service and don't need to give any other advice. The price and service are both great and the speed of arrival is great, only allow experienced drivers for Uber not new comers please."
92,I was using it every day and it was costing between 18 and $21 each way and then you get for people in bidding and they actually ripped me off hundreds and hundreds. I want to say thousands of dollars running my card and fighting over who was going to pick me up and yet I have not had any of my money returned are refunded. Getting through to a human being is like finding a needle in the haystack. They did not contact me back after writing a letter as well as contacting them by email and I don't appreciate all the rides that I did with them. I didn't receive one ride. All the people that I gave my share a code to 100s of friends and family not once did I get the $10 or $10 free ride or all the other things that they say it is. 
93,"Used Uber 3 times today. 1st ride was fine and picked up quickly and arrived as planned. 2nd ride the driver did not find me and cancelled on me even after calling to clarify my located. 3rd ride waited for 2 drivers that cancelled on me after waiting even long than the projected time to arrive. After waiting the projected for a 3rd driver who was not close to arriving at my located, I cancelled the driver and was charged a $5 fee. Since I am unable to rely on the Uber service, I will be cancelling my Uber account and use a taxi."
94,"Uber does only lip service in term of driver quality in India. A large number of uber cars are dirty, Acs hardly fictional, Drivers trying to defraud and overcharge, UBER customer support in India is dismal. I had a driver overcharge me by 200 rupees and Uber offered to refund 10 rupees. Joke!"
95,"I was in Madrid with my wife and it was around 8 pm in front of El Corte Ingles, big store like Macy's, so we decide to call Uber for get a ride to the hotel. We wait over 45 minutes, Uber never arrive. But the surprise was that Uber charge to my credit card $ 7.00 Euros ($9.00 US money twice total $18.00 US). On top of that they said that I took the ride to my hotel and the place another charge for $69.00 US. I dispute to the Bank of America for over two months, finally the bank say I have not prove of been or not taking the ride, therefore, ""Sorry we can't give you the refund."" So the Bank of America protect Uber, not the customer and to me Uber in Spain is totally a scam. Taxis in Madrid are excellent, inexpensive courteous driver and the best is that they're all over the city of Madrid."
96,"An Uber account that was recently set up was hacked today with my credit card info being use to charge at least 3 trips in North Carolina, all with the same driver. Fortunately my credit card company's security is such that they caught it shortly after I did and canceled the card. It seems to be virtually impossible to cancel the Uber account. None of the so-called Uber support numbers function nor can one find out how to do it online."
97,This service is a new means of transportation that is efficient and reliable but easy on your pocketbook. All this service needs is to also get involved in a new era of building cars that do not harm the environment.
98,"I like the idea that you can see where they are and exactly when they will arrive. I've only used them for short distances but they're always on time, very cordial, and never driving too fast! The fare is very cheap! I would never call a taxi again, unless that was my only alternative."
99,"They screwed me, and won't pay me for the rides I did. They said this week and still nothing so I'm taking Uber to court. They will pay me any way or another. You're not getting away with this Uber! I will get my money Uber. Remember Rhonda ** Uber! Cause you're gonna pay me!"
100,"In one case my son called for an Uber pickup. When she arrived my wife got in the back seat on the right side and slid across the seat. My son went to the left side but my wife was there, I told my wife she needed to move to the center. My wife is Vietnamese and has hearing issues. So after telling her twice I grabbed her jacket sleeve between thumb and forefinger and told her ""firm Voice"", ""You need to move to the center so my son can get in."" The female driver turned to me and told me to get. She would not have that in her car. They (uber) sent another car and my son filed a complaint. Two weeks later my son needed to get to a surgeon office for an appointment. The car they sent went the wrong way. They sent a second car but charged me for the driver going the wrong way. If I am to continue to use uber they will have to improve."
101,"I have been a happy Uber driver for 6 months now. It was great. Then all the sudden, in the middle of working; My account was put on hold. Now they are requiring $50 to pay for a class and I can't drive again until I pay them. This is something new. I don't appreciate the shake down so I am a happy Lyft driver now."
102,"UBER'S NEW SCAM CHARGING FOR CLEANING AFTER YOU LEAVE CAR. Me and my children rode with this creepy, stinky man. He dropped us off and an hour later charged us for a! cleaning fee for no reason. Uber drivers are now hitting everyone with cleaning fees and using Fake Pictures to prove it."
103,Today I booked Uber cab at 7:55pm. Estimated time was 4min. He took long time to reach the location. As I am patient recently I have undergone surgery. Due to delay from driver I have to bear a pain and swollen. Who is responsible for same?
104,I had booked a car today morning for going to the airport. They suddenly canceled the service and I missed my flight. Such a worst service being offered by such companies should be taken at utmost importance.
105,"I went to log in to my Uber Eats account to order food and I got an error message saying something was wrong with a past order. I went to my account and it immediately took me to Uber Rides site (which I have never used). I could SEE my partner's credit cards but I couldn't delete them. It kept telling me that the last order wasn't paid for but we never got a call or an email or anything. We got the food. That was weeks ago. Bob tells me he used a different card than the one on the account. I tried to order today, it wouldn't let me. I tried to see if the last order was outstanding, the site showed it was paid for. I entered yet another card totaling FOUR cards they have now! None worked. ALL are more than fine. Why are they asking for credit card info and not allowing me to remove it? If they aren't going to use any of them to place this order or pay for a supposed back order, then what are they doing with them?! "
106,"I requested a ride from Fort Worth, South Henderson Street to Irving Texas. The upfront fare they showed is 40.50 for economy ride and they said I have an offer of 25% max of 10$ per ride discount so it will be 30.50, then this driver Aashish in Toyota Corolla ** came and literally said “Oh I was going home"" and I got a ride which is exactly close to my home that’s convenient for him he said and then he took his own favorite route as per his wish and then at the end they charged me 8.96 dollars extra apart from 30.50 saying the toll charges, which means the total fare is 49-50$?? In a non busy period, that is never a fare till now. It’s maximum 35-36 and or 38-39 in a busy time. "
107,"I'm trying to dispute an Uber cancellation fee, and it's apparently impossible to do so on the website. You're told to click the arrow twice and select Problem with Cancellation Fee, but that's not findable. I'm bothered because I was at the location, having booked it just inside the building entrance and then having sat on a bench in front. The driver never called me, which he/she should have done if there was any confusion about the pickup point; I rebooked and connected with the new driver at the same location. Very poor service, I'm heading for Lyft from now on."
108,"Drivers take longer routes just to charge you money and they don’t give you, your money back. I had the worse taxi experience with this company, driver turn all the way around and they charged me distance and long and they didn’t want to give me my money back."
109,Uber driver stopped then drove off without explanation and cancelled my trip once he saw my grandmother was in a wheelchair. When making a complaint they said they would look into it but could not tell me the outcome. Disgraceful company.
110,I requested a ride to get back to my hotel. It was the same route I had just been driven 4 hours earlier. The driver took me 4 miles out of the way. He didn't turn around until I asked him where he was taking me. I was charged $61 for a $38 trip. I complained to Uber and they told me (3 times) that they had refunded the difference. They never did. I will never use Uber again.
111,"I have been trying to get an issue with Uber support over the app not working and them having a glitch in their system for the last 5 days, no one transfers you to a manager, they lie to you about opening a ticket with support. They have people like Maria ** from Uber Eats support telling me that she cannot get a supervisor to contact ME TELLING ME ""A SUPERVISOR HAS NO MORE POWER THEN HER TO ESCALATE MY CONCERNS."" I find that very hard to believe and also very upsetting. I have not been able to work due to their lack of empathy in solving the issue for the last 5 days and simply disrespecting me."
112,"Being a responsible driver, I made the decision to use Uber after a few drinks at a local cantina. My friends and I live within a couple miles of each other, so we shared the Uber. I was the second person to be dropped off and my sole set of keys (i.e. car, house, storage, work) fell out of my pocket. I realized I had left them in the backseat almost immediately, but had no way to contact the driver bc, unfortunately, my friend was the one who ordered the ride. My friend contacted him the next day (that was a feat within itself bc Uber drivers are extremely protected), but did not receive a response."
113,"Fun time with meeting an Uber driver. Was our first ride in Tampa, and he was awesome to recommend places. We gave him an extra tip. Wasn't pushy. Wasn't hard to talk with. Very outgoing. Knew the area well."
114,"If I could give them no stars I would.. I live in California and I am now in Greenville SC. Police and DMV allows me to drive with all my California documents but uBer does not. At first they said that I could drive, so I meet all the requirements and went to do my vehicle inspection in one of their recommended stores, paid, and then they rejected. So I called them and they said that it was because the inspection was filled out in the wrong paper. So I went to the store again, made them filled all the inspection again in their recommended paper only for them reject it again.. they screwed me up two times, lost money and time for nothing. I now understand why they are losing stock value big time.. because they really suck. I would never invest in this company ever. And I will never use their apps again.. Try Lyft!"
115,"It’s a wonderful concept and great most of the time. But it scares me a little bit. Ninety nine out of 100 times will be safe, you’ll be so glad that you did it. But it’s going to be that rare time, and has been times, when it wasn’t safe. Thus, I’m scared to do it as a single female. It’s safer as a group."
116,"Ordered UBER and driver never turned up, charged 23.59 pounds. UBER said my fault as I did not cancel trip. After waiting for over 30 minutes and driver never turned up even though app said driver 11 minutes away over and over. UBER should give the option of customer being able to call driver from app like other companies."
117,"I have been driving for Uber for about 6 months now, and they are horrible. When I try and cash out on fast pay it’s always something going on with their site. I really hate that when you call them nobody knows nothing. I sit online with Uber for over an hour and nobody even came back to the line. This company needs to be close because they are inconsistent and does nothing for no one other than Uber. I would not recommend them to nobody not even my damn dog."
118,I clicked on at the rate of $12.84. Got my ride. When I looked at my account it was charged $18.18. Of course the people in Calif said that is the rate. No matter how I explained it no go. Then I earned Gold status with a $5 Uber rewards. The ride that normally cost $18 dollars went up to $24. Wrote to them again about not using my Uber reward instead raised my rate. The company as far as a company goes SUCKS. The drivers I get are wonderful. I tip them cash and tell them when Uber is charging me $24.00 because they are not seeing that and they are getting ripped off. Uber company sucks. Never look for any resolution to any issue that will never happen. Forget earning uber cash. They just mess with you.
119,"After an hour of waiting for our food, Uber tracking online said it was delivered but no food. Contacted the restaurant, they said not their problem but did give us the driver mobile number, We rang the driver, and she said that she couldn't find the address so she binned it. Submitted a complaint via Uber forms and no response. We will no longer use Uber Eats... It's a pity because the Uber taxi is a good service but I may need to cancel my account in protest."
120,I just got charged an extra $20 for a trip that allegedly took 20 min than it actually did. I was dropped off 20 min earlier than shown in the receipt. Uber’s receipt is based on false information that Uber has profited from. Disgraceful!
121,"I stopped driving for Uber in August of 2019. It is now February 2020 and I'm getting the runaround from Uber driver support about my tax documents. I've placed several phone calls to gain access to my account. All I get is responses regarding why I stopped driving for Uber. Their CSR agents have an awful time understanding me, and I them. Never work for Uber...Never ride with Uber."
122,"I do really appreciate the value of the Uber Pool. You can't beat the cost. Drivers are typically very friendly, but the GPS they use is terrible. I usually have to direct them because the GPS is so lacking."
123,"The last two times I have taken an Uber from my work to my home in the suburbs they have added $2.86 SURCHARGE. The surcharge says for tolls/parking/etc so I didn't figure it would apply to me. My work is in a suburb. I used Uber twice in two days, first time at 11:30am and second time at 930pm. NO SPORTS around, NO CONCERTS around, NOTHING around. They added $2.86 SURCHARGE. So when I wrote them they said prime time/weather/sporting events/etc could be the reason??!! WRONG! Nothing near me except 15 Uber cars spinning around waiting. This is fraud if they do not have to tell you WHAT the surcharge is for?? They can't tell me why I have paid it for both of my rides. They just keep saying due to ""high volume"". So I asked when is NOT HIGH VOLUME?? They said they do not know. FRAUD. Please investigate them. Thx!"
124,"So I take Uber pool service to office every day. It has been more than two years now. I have had normal experiences as well as extremely bad ones. Now, recently, in the past one month Uber services has becoming so pathetic that it is crossing all limits. Firstly, I do not get cabs at all, even by luck if I do, the route is such that it takes me a lot of time to reach. Well, that is still acceptable given that pool cabs are supposed to be like that. Half an hour or 45 mins extra is okay with me."
125,My elderly mother took ill and was hospitalized. I immediately booked a bus to head to the state she resides as I have moved away. The driver came to my neighborhood. I called to guide him to my home and he cancelled causing me to not be able to make my bus on time and unable to get a refund on my ticket. I am out of $70 bus fare with Uber basically offering no help or a solution. I was unable to spend for another ticket which leaves my mother to go home without care upon her discharge. The driver should be made to pay for my financial loss as people depend on their services. I was given no assistance and told they were unable to do anything about my financial loss.
126,"I am a regular user of Uber cabs from the moment it was introduced in Hyderabad. I never had major issues with the services and I am happy to be using their hassle free services except for the Uber ride services. I have been using Uber ride pass since September 4 2018 and for the month of November this would be 3rd time of opting the Uber ride pass services for the year 2018. Since September 2018 the Uber ride pass flat fare is made applied along with overage on 90% of my rides during September and October 2018 rides. During one such ride, the fare was calculated wrongly and extra amount was charged instead of the actual amount which was shown before confirming the ride. "
127,"This complaint is as much for Uber as it is its insurance company, the James River Insurance Company. I was hit by an Uber driver on August 25th, 2018 in Connecticut while riding on my motorcycle. Although I suffered many injuries, I am alive and am grateful for that. What I am not grateful for is Uber's insurance company that still has not settled on a fair price for my totaled motorcycle. I had a lot taken from me that night and have had zero compassion from the insurance company that represents Uber drivers. I have made numerous phone calls and emails to James River Insurance Company without return calls or emails. It's now going on five months with no agreement on a settlement, and that is appalling. I will be publishing more news about Uber and James River Insurance company on this site and others in the upcoming days. My goal will be to spread awareness about unfair practices that are being used by both companies."
128,Thanks for the lesson Uber. From now on I will use a cab and will pay for actual service not just effort.
129,"I ordered an UBER by entering the facility name on Monday. There was no issue with arriving time and price, then I confirmed it. However when I arrived there, it was not the one I wanted to go to. I definitely entered the correct facility name and the name of building I arrived was not even same name as I entered. Also I had to add the correct address by myself and they charged me again. I’m sure that the address UBER programmed into their system was wrong and they took me to the wrong place (driver was nice)."
130,"Better than a taxi any day. Taxi have ripped off its customers for years and finally, a alternative is available. Political pressure from the News and Politiations upset because they don't get the kickback from regulations threaten the company but Uber is safer than Taxi, you know who and the car coming to pick up even the location on the map."
131,"Have a problem with Uber gift card and it's been 2 months as of April 2019. After being bounced around from different Uber helpers via email since you can't call into uber, the problem is still not fixed with my gift card. Every response is an automate response because they never read the full compliant. Finally got move to a manager and the response was also automated. Was told they can't do anything if you gift card got stolen, when I never mention it being stolen. I have to card but then it's not working, so uber robbed me of $200.00 now!"
132,"I signed up with Uber Eats as a driver to make some extra cash late nights. Typically from midnight till about rush hour. It was going great! I had a five star rating, only ever had one complaint out of hundreds of deliveries... it was good. But then I got a notice. I was violating ""community guidelines"" by canceling too many orders - FROM CLOSED RESTAURANTS. So I contacted their ""partner support."" Contacting them by phone appeared to do nothing as they simply filed a ""ticket"" and left it to the people who answer the app. They constantly gave me pre-written responses about how we shouldn't cancel orders so that the customer is happy. So... how do we handle closed restaurants? They told me that I needed to cancel those orders. But again, I was canceling too many. From closed restaurants. I appealed their review twice and they decided to just ban me instead."
133,"I've found their service to be top notch. The app is wonderfully efficient. The ability to track the progress of your ride is very comforting. And, the prices for the rides are very good. All the drivers I've had are very nice."
134,"I used UBER yesterday for a ride to my home address. After 3 mins in the car, I realized the traffic was too much so I asked the driver to drop me off at the nearest train station instead, which was just 7 minutes away from the spot where he picked me up. My wife booked the UBER thru her phone so I assume the driver would change the drop off location on his phone. An hour later, I receive my Uber receipt for a staggering $60.46!!! I was shocked because according to the receipt, the driver stated that he dropped me off at home which is a lie. I cannot believe they would lie like that and charge me $60.46 for a 7 minute drive. I try contacting Uber four times over this matter but they are not resolving it."
135,"I had booked a ride to take us from a restaurant on Canal Street, to the West Village. The driver stopped at the wrong place. We signaled him NOT to make a U turn on a busy street: we'd cross with the light. We did. He charged us for waiting time. Then he took the wrong route, and we wound up in New Jersey. We told him he had the wrong route, and he screamed ""I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING."" In Jersey City, there was an accident in front of us - a bad one. He swerved, and nearly started a second one. Then he told us ""as a courtesy"" he wouldn't charge the NJ surcharge. After we got back to NY (another ""courtesy"", he wouldn't charge us the toll), he started taking us to Brooklyn. Twice. Again 'I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING'. Two sixty year olds have to act like James Bond and jump out of the car when it stops, to get away. We were further downtown than when we started. Uber's reaction? ""Oh well, we refunded your fare."""
136,"Yesterday I took 2 Uber, like I typically (if not daily) use. On my uber ride home, everything seemed normal. I had a nice chat with my driver as he dropped me off from a 10 min ride. Hours after, I see my Paypal and Credit card statements, and realize Uber has charged me $150 for a ""Cleaning Fee"". They are suggesting that I made a mess to my drivers car. Apparently, the driver sent them a generic picture of a wet at and charge me $150. Mind you, this extra charge/modification was made some hours after my ride was completed."
137,"I was exceptionally satisfied with Uber until yesterday. On reaching my location, my app showed a payment amount. The Uber driver requested a higher amount than the app request. I paid what the app showed, and the cash function on my account was revoked. Follow up customer service? Was shocking despite me using the service daily. Wrong platform to answer the query, electronic response. Nobody can or will assist with a genuine query. I've installed Taxify."
138,"From a driver standpoint, the rating system is unfair. All it takes to ruin your reputation is one passenger having a bad day that they take out on you. And don't get me started on the maps. They like to send you five miles in the wrong direction."
139,Uber is overcharging for Toll fees. When In Florida the Tolls fees estimates between $ .75 to $ 2.00. Uber price shown will be Example $ 16.73 for the ride. After you take the ride you get charge 28.23 and when you check the account it's telling you that you got charge for Tolls. The driver never took the toll route and you try to contact Uber company and they take long to get back to you about the issue of being overcharge. I try to email them and let them know about the extra charges and why am I being charge for a service that I didn't receive.
140,"I have used this service a few times, the only issue I had was updating my address. I still can't figure out where that is on my app. My delivery driver always has to call me to get my address. But other than that I feel this is a great service and it kinda sucks that you need to get a business license now to be a driver. Hope rates don't go up."
141,"DO NOT EVER USE PLEASE! Months and months ago they charged me double for many of my trips saying it's just a ""hold charge"" and I'll get my money back but I never did. They owe me 35 bucks left. They suck so badly at replying and when they do they say they'll help but never do. They owe my mother money as well but did she get her money? Nope? Wtf is a hold anyways???? You double charge for no reason. SCAM. DO NOT USE PLEASE!!! IF YOU DONT BELIEVE ME, check Instagram on their page, many people complain like me."
142,I used Uber for travel to and from airports. It is a great way to get to my planes or final destination that is often a good distance from the airports.
143,"I arranged for a ride from LaGuardia Airport and was taken to the wrong location. It took us half an hour out of way and cost us $50 for the mistake. When I sought to complain, it proved impossible to get a response from Uber other than automated messages about tolls and other unrelated topics. And, there is no one to call. My advice: Try Lyft."
144,"I've only needed to use a car service about 4 times a year - I have an SUV. Yellow or green cabs are rare in the northern tip of Manhattan. Uber has been consistent with quality cars, very pleasant and professional drivers and no hidden fees. Highly recommend."
145,"I have used Uber during the day or early evenings. The drivers are very dependable and reliable. They are courteous and have displayed in my experience, a sincere professional attitude. I have felt very safe as a passenger."
146,"I took Uber like I have many, many times before. I was taking my dog to the groomer and he was on my lap. He met left my lap and I carried him out the car. Needless to say he never made any mess. A day later I received notice from Uber that they had charged $150 dollar cleaning fee plus the regular fee. I emailed them and they sent me fraudulent pictures the driver had sent them saying the dog urinated on his rug. The picture was clearly the front seats of the car and I was in the back seat. Uber still said they believed their driver and would not refund me the money."
147,"I had a promo on my account for at least a few months now. $5 off ALL rides in Toronto. It applied to Pool and Uber X. It would automatically renew. No issues. All of a sudden almost 2 weeks ago I noticed it was only on the Uber X. So I sent a message. They told me it was only applicable to X. This isn't a new promo code. It's the same. That was always applicable to Pool. You can't just change rules. You need to change the actual promo. I know 2 people who still have it applicable to Pool. After going back and forth for almost a week, now my messages go unanswered. Not even the generic message they send. Straight ignored. And I know they're waiting for the promo to expire which is either today or tomorrow. It's absolutely disgusting to have that kind of service. I've been a rider for 3 years. Took Uber EVERY day. It's a $5 promo. Which other riders still have. Sickened at the way this has been dealt with."
148,I have found Uber to be much more convenient than taxis and faster. Drivers have always been pleasant and helpful. When I'm travelling around the US and I'm in a new city it's a great way to get around.
149,"Uber was a life saver when we needed it. The drivers were all wonderful courteous people but the company was not so great. There is no way to get help or even talk to someone from the company and the app was difficult to navigate. There were added fees like Uber technology fee that were not explained or mentioned that was just taken out of our account. There wasn’t even a way to ask about it and the drivers got none of the extra money!! Lastly, I kept getting strange texts for Uber codes after I began the process of trying to be a driver. I changed my mind when I found out someone was already trying to hack my account and rack up an unknown amount of charges on it. I will not use Uber again unless it is like the last time I had to do it an emergency with no other options."
150,"1. Ride arrivals times are frequently changed. 2. Prices from airport is 3 times than home to airport 3. When traveling abroad, frequently Uber drives cancels the ride and I am penalized. It is very difficult to get charged reversed after 2 times. 4. It is very hard to get customer service on the phone. 5. If I cancel, I pay the penalty but if driver canceled the ride, there is no reimbursement or discount on substitute ride."
151,"I have used Uber twice and received good service. The drivers were prompt and polite and UBER billed me correctly and efficiently. However, today I had a bad experience. I contacted Uber. I was told the driver was 3 minutes away at a nearby market, which is about 3 minutes from my home. I waited 10 minutes and the driver was still 3 minutes away at the same market. I waited 15 minutes, then I texted the driver to tell them that since they didn't show, I wanted a credit. I had to get a ride from someone else since I was already late for my appointment."
152,I requested an 8 mile ride in Boston on a Saturday night around 1:00 am that was coming up around $55 on the app and Lyft was around the same rate. Ended up taking a regular cab that cost me $20. Beware of high rates.
153,"I've decided to write a review only after a second experience of this kind. I will continue to keep close tabs on all Uber charges from now on. The fìrst time I was charged for a round trip to and from airport at the next pay level up (limo level). Uber was adamant about the charge along with the driver, despite the verifiable fact that had I actually made the trip reported, I wouldn't have landed in another city which happened to be 2 hours away by plane. This was 3 hours after I arrived at airport. The other issue verifiable by Uber's hold on my credit card for the correct amount. Price was double the authorized charge."
154,The first time they left me because I wasn't outside fast enough and when I did the app again that morning the price had gone up. Time was of the essence because I needed to get to the airport. I then took a shared ride. That's when I learned what that means and everyone wasn't going to the airport.
155,"I just had my second experience with Uber doubling my fare. The quoted fare was MX $73 pesos and I was charged MX $148.99. A taxi to my destination, which I go regularly, is MX $80. I would never get in a cab without confirming the fare, or buy an airline ticket. Why would Uber expect me to do that? For the fare to be over DOUBLE the quote is criminal. Why would I continue to use Uber if their rates are double that of a taxi?"
156,"I’m a long time Uber user. I’ve been taking rides from home to the airport for business trips multiple times a year. I also use Uber overseas often. On my most recent ride, there was a new fee called Long Pickup fee, which applies when the driver has to drive a long distance to pick you up. According to what I read online in blogs, the fee applies after a certain distance and it adds up slowly (cents per mile). Uber refuses to explain to me how my recent ride incurred $13 of Long Pickup fee. I scheduled the ride for a later time because there were many options available within 10 minutes away and I needed the driver to arrive in 30 minutes. Fellow passengers, be aware that scheduling in advance may put you at risk of hidden fees that they refuse to explain in details."
157,"My rating is 4.84, I’ve been with Uber over 3 years and I am a platinum member so the fact that I am not able to get a ride pass and or real discounts considering how often I ride with Uber and how expensive the rides actually are I am disappointed and saddened with this company. It honestly makes me feel like this is a company that only cares for money solely. If you look at my history it is seen how often I use the app and how much I am spending. The ride pass is for selected customers in my area. Also Uber does not keep up with their drivers. I have been in dirty cars and have been in one incident with a driver and another almost hit a cop car!!! Every time I get in a car it is almost always something honestly and it’s tiring having to always reach out, it seems like they’d accept anyone to work for them."
158,The only problem I ever had was at Las Vegas airport at passenger pick up. I had to wait almost an hour and had to cancel twice before a driver actually showed they were going to airport. All other places were good.
159,"As a university professor there is little problem dropping me at the garage structure near my office, But returning home is a terrible problem. The pickup point does not show for the Uber driver and even when talking with him or her on the phone as s/he make her way slows the process considerably. Yesterday, the driver, a nice man, was 20 minutes late as I waited in the cold, delivered me to an incorrect address, then was surprised when I gave him my home address far away because he had no record of it. "
160,"I had not used Uber before and was staying at a hotel. I asked someone at the desk to help me order a ride for the next AM. That morning 6 Ubers showed up, all but one driver understood, 5 excused the order but 1 driver not only would not but was very ugly to me. My bank had to decline the charge as he would not. The next Am a wonderful driver came and helped me and I had a wonderful ride and great talks on my way."
161,"Unable to sign in to app. Able to sign in to website, but cannot update any information. Cannot add credit card or payment option. Cannot find a way to use their advance ride scheduling. Contacted support, which was absolutely useless. They did not address my issues at all. NUTS!!!"
162,"Very pleasant drivers, very clean cars, great price too. Overall excellent experience. I will use again and recommend my family and friends to use Uber."
163,"I started to work for Uber in November of 2019, my first week was horrible, trying to learn how to work the app, because Uber does not help you to learn the app. Another thing when I applied to work with Uber it was a horrible experience as I had to wait 3 weeks before I was able to drive because everything had to be done the way they wanted like how I took pictures of my car, pictures of myself, pictures, of all documents and so on. In my second week, I learned a little more about the app because I had to ask other drivers, but this is where I start missing money from the Uber Visa card. I really worked my bottoms off. I was working 12 1/2 hours a day, I was so excited because I had made $845.00 that week so I cashed out my money to find out that I had no money."
164,"My husband and I arranged a ride to the airport with Uber. We were notified the evening before our ride that our ride had been set up. When the time for our pick up, with no driver in sight, had come and gone by not just a few minutes but by almost 30 minutes we realized we had to get ourselves to the airport in order to catch our flight. This not only caused a lot of undue stress but a whole lot of money. We had to pay for 2 days of parking at the airport and for someone to pick up our vehicle. When trying to issue a complaint to Uber about this matter, they have been unresponsive. We will NEVER trust Uber again. This has NEVER happened to us with a taxi service."
165,"I used this company yesterday for 1st time. Ok but driver had an attitude about where I sat and the distance. Today I was watching the app to see where he was - right at the time I expected him to drive in the drive - it said cancelled. I had to be at work very soon. I do not like to drive or walk in this snowy, icy weather so I called them. I had to drive to work - walk across icy parking lot - at the last minute. And then they charge me a stupid fee because he traveled a distance. The addresses listed were not even the right ones. I got an Uber credit - now why would I want to use this company again!!!! I am a Sr Citizen - my money is tight and I need a refund on my card not a credit. What a bunch of crap!!!"
166,Uber is a total rip-off. They scam drivers every day. You always see premium possible for long pickups but never get them. This means it should be a surge because no drivers are in that area. I have copies of all the premium possible trips and never get premium but charge rider a big premium. My last one was a 2.7 mile trip that took 5 minutes. Had to drive 18 minutes to get there and almost 5.5 miles. The rider paid 14.26. I got 5.43 and that included a 1.70 long pickup! Anyone who says they aren’t screwing drivers is either an idiot or a troll for Uber! That is criminal. I have pics of every one. What rider would pay 14.26 for a 2.7 mile ride that took five minutes??? Had to be surge! I had to drive 18 minutes and 5.5 miles to get to rider.
167,"From Uber: ""Sorry to hear about the trouble here."" Uber charges customers a fee for tipping drivers. They call it a “tax”. Since when are additional taxes added to tips? Completely illegal. From Uber: “It shows here that there is a tax in New York City that was automatically added on your tip. But rest assured that the only amount of the tip you have provided the delivery partner is $4.00 and it is the exact amount that was deducted from your Stored Value or Uber Credit.” Hope this helps. Have a wonderful day! Sent by Baren on Friday, January 18, 2019 at 2:52:36 PM”."
168,"Uber Eats/Uber Rides are fraudulent! My daughter ordered Uber Eats, and her card was charged for a ride and eats. When I called to see why the Eats was charged so much on the account, they told me they added a Uber Ride from 2017. The bad part about this is I had just opened this account for her summer of 2019 so the card was never a valid or active card 2 years ago. And how can you just add a ride onto the Eats app?? I called the company to dispute the charges, and I was hung up on!! The most disrespectful service I ever experienced!! Still in battle with the company, but I will never use either again. If you choose to use either app, watch your charges! This company is very sneaky stealing money from customers!"
169,"Ordered food through UberEats. Driver ran away with food. Uber charges me for the food anyway stating that's their policy. Contacting customer service certifies that there isn't a concept of service, the agents only correspond via email and have kept on sending generic comments without attempting to understand what may have happened. Every correspondence is abruptly closed without any resolution. When I posted a review on the Google play store, the company immediately responds that I can contact them for assistance. When I did that the same circus started again. This is the worst customer service by any standard."
170,"I usually have good experiences with Uber but this one driver charged us for a cleaning fee, his vehicle was already a mess to begin with. Not sure why Uber doesn’t do anything to protect consumers about these kinds of charges. We didn’t bring anything with us or did we have any food or any accidents in the vehicle."
171,I am Permanent Resident with a valid G driver's License. I have tried creating a driver account with Uber multiple times but Uber keeps rejecting my documents. Sometimes they tell me to go to police station or go do my fingerprints and then tell me to go to Greenlight Hub. I have been doing this multiple times but so far Uber has been cheating me. I have wasted many days in going back and forth with this criminal company.
172,This is the worst company and untrustworthy. I used them couple of times and until American Express offer 15 dollars for Uber ride monthly and Uber did not credit me for the first ride and I take 3 rides in one day but none of them was credit the 15.00 dollars until I order food and still didn’t credit until I cancel my orders within minute that I order through Marco pizza in Norcross. And when I cancel the order which is total of 33 dollars and some change that’s when Uber credited me after I cancel the order and I am still being charged for the food that I never had from Uber eats that they claim Marco pizza is already made my food and how’s that possible after 1 min of ordering and have to cancel right away. 
173,"I live in The Bronx, The epicenter of Covid19. I used an Uber to pick up my elderly Mom at the Doctor’s Office. As the driver arrived, he managed to get on the opposite side of the street, I’m holding a few bags and helping my Mom across the street to the car. I get in the car and he drives to our destination. As I was helping my Mom off her coffee dripped through the bag. It was a couple of drops, I asked the driver for a napkin to clean it off, he said, ""Don’t worry about it. I will take care of it"" and pointed to his napkins. I told him I can clean it. He said, ""No I will do it."" I was rushing to get my Mom inside the building, I trusted the driver to clean it off, since he knew I had my hands full but I still wanted to make sure I had every intention to wipe it down. Well, I get upstairs and I started to add the tip and rating. "
174,"Uber is great for infrequent rides like to events at small venues, trips to the airport, etc. It features reasonable convenience and cost; however, surge pricing punished folks who had come to depend on Uber for more frequent usage."
175,"I have used Uber 4 times and never again. Three were horrible experiences and they make it almost impossible to contact Customer Service and when I asked the lady via e-mail to call me and gave her my number because I have a tear in my shoulder, she would not respond. All 3 of these bad experiences were men who tried their lack of English as an excuse. I taught Special Ed 23 yrs. Most people’s issues is that people try to use their language as an excuse for their poor behavior. So, that gives drivers excuses to play sex music where it’s talking about what a woman will do after you give her 3 shots and 5 shots. Dang, alone in a car with a stranger and he’s playing that music, drivers refusing to go towards your house and taking trips that makes the distance 3 times farther just to charge you more."
176,Worst taxi service.. driver canceled a ride in last moment after waiting of 15 min. I have received call from driver after book ride and he told that he is coming. I waited and then in last min application searching for another car and it shows 20min. Worst ever experienced...
177,"I ordered an Uber home with one additional stop to pick up some food, as he dropped me off to pick up the food I told him I would be right back and he said ok, when I got my food and came outside he was gone without a trace and upon checking my phone it said the trip was complete. I paid $17 for this trip and he did not take me home. Instead he robbed me and I was left stranded outside without any money to order another ride."
178,"I am a long standing rider with Uber, had better and worse experiences, but recently I was shocked by them. I rode with my mom and my mom opened a bottle of club soda, basically water with gas in it, and it spilled a bit. She apologized and cleaned it, but it is water after all. When you step into a car from the rain, you bring water in... We were charged with 80$(!!) cleaning fee. I sent them pictures of what they called the “mess” along with pictures the bottle in question. They still insisted on charging 20$ fee for cleaning water... And here I thought water IS a cleaning agent and not something to be cleaned."
179,The process for getting a ride is easy through the Uber app. Knowing the identity of the driver and the car type and tag number before arrival gives an added measure of safety. Drivers are usually friendly and cars are clean. Frequent Uber user.
180,For the most part I've been very happy with Uber and their drivers. I do feel at times the cost is a bit too much but overall I'm very happy with Uber. In all the times that I've ridden with Uber I've only had one person who didn't know where she was going and took us way out of our way but other than that it's been great!
181,I received half coke all spilled and fries were all sad and Mc Oreo flurry was open all melted.. I send feedback immediately on app.. Send pic of coke too.. And they only refunded for Oreo flurry.. Rest all food was wasted.. BUT NIRAJ ** said that madam apne Sirf Oreo k bare me Likha.. But he dint understand English review about entire order was waste.. And was arguing with me on call... Highly not recommended... Zomato and Swiggy is far better... At least Customer service is literate there.
182,"I schedule two Ubers for a trip to the airport for a group of 6. The first Uber arrived and took half of the group. The second Uber was late. As per their policy, I was credited $10 for being late. I could see the Uber coming up the street, then turn around and cancel us. He said he had car trouble. My guess is he had just been notified he lost $10 for running late and decided not to complete the ride. There were no other rides available for more than an hour. We had to drive ourselves and pay for parking for the entire trip, plus pay for the additional Uber which we would not have needed if I knew we were driving ourselves. Uber just sent a canned response/apology. Unacceptable service!"
183,"We ordered an UBER 12 hrs. ahead of time for a trip to the airport. We were ready, packed and just waiting for the scheduled pickup (which UBER texted). Ten minutes before our scheduled pickup we received a text stating that they were canceling due to our VISA card being expired. We DO NOT travel with expired credit cards. We did check our card and we had TWO years before expiration. Since UBER canceled, I started from scratched, ordered an UBER with the same card and it was processed (our driver was great, not his fault). We did make our flight but was very fast paced and very stressful. Maybe we need to order an UBER 24/48 hrs. ahead of time and if UBER needs to cancel for whatever reason, maybe they will give us the courtesy to text us with sufficient time."
184,"No problems with the riders. Uber app charged the incorrect card at the end of the ride, despite profile setup. No big deal here. I requested the charge to be switched to the other in the account and they could not make this basic transaction in more than 10 days I left the ticket open. My periodic follow-ups were useful only to be told that a specialized team was looking into it. I never asked for troubleshooting details but only for the charge to be switched between the cards registered in the account. Customer service just bounced me back every time with no excuse, given the type of request. I could not add that ride to my expense report in time to be reimbursed by my company as it was a business trip. Thanks Uber for that!"
185,"Their system of Uber Cash cash to not allow partial payment for rides is atrocious. This is simply a way for them to keep our cash and use it for their own interest bearing bank account. Nothing Against the drivers, but the company tactics are."
186,"I’ve use Uber for the last 2 years and never complained about anything even when I had small issues. Today I’ve tried to talk to a human being for the last 4 hours and there is NONE existence!! The automated stupid robot keeps emailing be nonsense - I asked for A ride at 4:30 am and it said driver is 9 min away for $35 rate - after 30 minutes I saw on the app that the driver is struggling to find the place - I called, texted and no response. Finally he canceled. Second driver showed 7 min away with the same rate. The same exact thing except this one the driver at least called. Trust me I don’t live in a desert. I’ve had many rides on the same location. "
187,"I complained to Uber and asked for a refund. The driver they sent had the dirtiest vehicle I have been in. The dirt & stains were all over the seats, doors & floors. It was so bad I thought I would have stains on my light color pants from sitting down. Uber refused to do anything about it or refund my money."
188,"The driver was late and he smelled badly. He was rude and a bit disconcerting. I considered not staying in the car, but I was going to be late if I waited for another ride. I wish I had done that."
189,"When a driver gets lost, it should NOT be the rider that pays for that mistake. It is a reliable service but costly. Also, there isn't a way to get your money back for mistakes made by driver... like taking twice as long to get me to work."
190,"I bought $75.00 worth of Uber credits I needed to get to work. Tried to log in and it said my password was incorrect, etc... I gave all the relevant info needed to update my account. I can't log in so I had to call my job to let them know I was having transportation issues. This is day 3. I emailed Uber customer support and it just goes into a loop (please send screenshot of phone number you would like to use)...total nightmare. I expect a refund and won't stop until I get one. There is no excuse for what they did. From now on I'll take Lyft."
191,"01/28/19. In the morning I had a fine ride to the Courthouse. In the afternoon I requested a ride back home. Ride 1: I didn’t move from where I called. After the 5 minutes wait Uber sent a cancellation message. Immediately I booked again. Ride 2: Uber message asked me to walk 2 long blocks to a different pickup location within 3 minutes. I informed that it was an impossibility because I have mobility difficulties. I walked half block on that time. A new cancellation message came. I didn’t call again. I was forced to use the reliable public transportation because I could not rely on a next call to Uber. I got NO UBER RIDE, my card had been charged $20.00 (3 times the original fee). I got $10.00 towards the next ride. This is a nightmare and feels like a scam. I need a full refund to my card and not a discount for the next ride. Please correct these transactions."
192,"THE DRIVERS WERE GREAT! BOTH WAYS TO AND FROM THE AIRPORT. While coming back from the airport there was a major traffic jam. The driver took an alternate route because it was late at night, and he paid the tolls, so I tipped him well. He deserved it!"
193,"My first issue came when my payments were declined and called fraud because I didn't set my pickup point at my exact address, but instead at a more convenient pick up spot for myself and the driver. Managed to solve this issue. The next issue, I attempted to purchase Uber credit, to be declined. My bank had cash in it, but refuses to accept payment. Furthermore, according to them, I still owe a $1.03 balance for some reason. Speaking of, why am I paying .03 for every dollar I give as a tip? And technical support (if you can call it that) just repeats itself and the directions to whatever issue you have with no guidance whatsoever. Really insulting. Used to be a great service, but now I guess they've decided to rest on their laurels."
194,I was charged 60 dollars for a ride that was only 16 dollars. I was also put through hell just to get in contact with their support team who did nothing to credit my account. I was then told that it was given in UBER credit after they overdrafted my account. I am very upset that my issue has not been resolved and it happen a week ago. Bad customer support.
195,"Like any business, Uber is all about the money and despite that fact they fail to invest in their technology. My driver drove right past me while I'm waving my arms and kept going. She continued to drive around for 15 minutes instead of going around the block. As a result I missed my bus home for the holidays because she also drove lost and ignored the route that she was supposed to take and it kept rerouting her. Uber's response? Should have canceled when she drove past. Excuse me? Cancel and gets charge her driving and Uber's GPS? I fought back and they said policies and things aren't changing and I don't have to ride with them. Yeah you are right, I don't. Thank you, next."
196,I have drove for Uber more than a two years and their customer service never understand your problems. Uber never takes responsibility if a rider damage your car. Recently a rider ripped the plastics off the door and Uber representatives said is a normal used issue!! My car is eight month old and the other doors are perfect. I’m so upset. Drive for Lyft. Customer support is better!!!
197,"People have been going on strike since Uber reduced the pay to drivers. It is now about the same as Lyft or a tad better. I am an Uber/Lyft Driver and let me tell you. I hope both of these companies go away. Let riders go back to Taxis days where they never show up or show up rude and disrespectful in unclean cars. Let's see if both of these companies will appreciate drivers and pay them fairly for the HARD work they do. Such as ending up in a place that's 1.5 hours and having to drive 1.5 hour home just for one trip and get pay nothing. They pay is very little to drivers considering gas (how expensive recently and continue rising as of May 13,2019), maintenance every 2-3 months, car depreciation with high mileage each day. Do not bother to go on Strike. Drivers please just GET OFF the road so that there's not many drivers left with no drivers on the road but tons of riders. "
198,Uber in the Southwestern corner of AZ has increased the prices by 11% and are keeping anywhere from 40 to 60% of the fare. Charging for a longer distance but send the driver the shortest. Lyft has con up by 6% and is still cheaper than uber.
199,"Uber has made transportation much easier, however, it is overrated and expensive. Uber only cares about $ and drivers but does not care about customers at all. First there is not a phone number to reach if you ever encounter any kinds of problems. Only 10% of drivers are actually nice and professional. Uber taking your money when the driver cancels the ride is just ridiculous. Uber should not cut $$ from your account even if you cancel the ride. If our ride cancellations affects the drivers, then Uber should be able to solve that issue for drivers. Customers should not be paying even for a single penny, if they don’t use the ride."
200,Uber gave me 25% off to ride. Turned out Lyft was still cheaper by $3. Airport to house Uber pool $12 inclusive of 25% discount. Lyft was $9 no promos. Do NOT believe Uber's bogus promos. Always turn on both apps and compare fares.
201,"Earlier, Uber was great. They used to provide prompt customer service and quick redressal of issues. Now, there is no person you can speak to, there is no acknowledgement even if you complain and random multiple charges are being deducted for the same trip. Thank God for Ola, otherwise UBER is such a scam."
202,"I've been using Uber for 10 years..when it began in SF, Ca. I used it in NYC, NJ and now Los Angeles, CA. I cannot drive due to my disability and before uber I had to live in cities with great mass transit like SF and NYC. But because of Uber and their amazing cost (comparison to a car) concern of their riders/drivers...I am available to live anywhere in the world now. (Well almost!) I've met amazing drivers, people...and in my 10 years have only had 3 or 4 drivers I've had to make a report on their behavior. (It's like customer service...some people are just not made for it)."
203,Upfront pricing not true pricing. Uber pads the bill so much. I've had Uber drivers charge for wait time when they are parked down from my house and I am out on my front porch waiting and watching them. Booking fee $3.05 come on! Toll and surcharges plus time and distance charges. Now they are dropping me off a few blocks from my destination saying they got to take another call. Uber drivers that I have used have showed up at my house wanting a hookup. One driver started groping me on my front porch. Uber customer service is a brick wall. Credited me $3.00 on a ride on Uber Cash. No matter what they do or charge they have an excuse and they are right. When I reported the sexual harassment of the two drivers they suspended my account. They cost more than a taxi and a taxi never has told me to get out and walk the rest of the way. 
204,"I'm a weekend driver with Uber and have been for 4 years. Uber requires an annual background check, which I 100% agree with. This was usually done in a day or 2 and never impeded my ability to drive. This year, they are not only taking a really long time for approval (over a week already), but it is preventing me from driving until the review is completed."
205,First and foremost I want to make it clear that up until recently I loved Uber and their customers service. I have spent hundreds in the last 3 weeks alone. First negative experience was a driver demanding an extra 10$ stating we needed an xl vehicle (which we did not) or he was driving away. Now this day it was difficult to get a ride. Many had cancelled so I complied. I was then made aware that they werent allowed to do this. I contacted customer service in which they happily  refunded this showing me they cared about their customers.  
206,Poor experience with using promo. Feels like scam as the company keeps giving wrong explanations although the promo is active on the app. I have been requesting Uber support to look into it and sent several emails but same questions and wrong explanations given. Requested them to take off the promo code or honour it. Lyft is way better and more transparency in terms of promo and pricing. Don’t waste your time on using the Uber app or don’t get sucked into their promos. It’s a scam.
207,"After many attempts explaining my situation, it became apparent that Uber has among the worst customer service I've ever experienced. Many contacts with Uber regarding this issue, here was my final attempt to receive fairness from this company. Actually my final attempt was today, Oct. 15, 2018 where I was advised that my claim is too old, their final excuse to keep my money. I began this process within a week of the trip. Here's my story..."
208,"9/30/2018 Arizona Cardinals game. Request Uber driver, app says driver will arrive in 11 minutes. 30+ minutes go by, driver doesn't show up. I call the driver, he says he is on his way, 2 minutes later, driver cancels on me. Without my permission, Uber says they are finding another driver. Another 30 minutes goes by, driver calls and says he came and didn't see me and left. Said he'd come back. I watch, 2 minutes later that driver cancels on me. I wasted 1 hour in the parking lot waiting for two drivers who cancelled on me. "
209,"I'm a 68 year old ** woman. I downloaded the UBER app in Chicago (Midway Airport) before traveling home alone to Arkansas. My travel required me to fly from Chicago Midway Airport to Dallas Love Field where I needed to connect to Dallas Ft. Worth Corporate Aviation Airport. I could not schedule the trip until I got to Dallas Love Field. I was assigned a driver (Steven) who picked me up in a black Cadillac SUV. Once in the vehicle, the driver stated my destination had not come through to him yet. About a mile or so from the airport, the driver pulled into a liquor store parking lot (4114 Mockingbird Lane), so that I could fix the problem with the app. Somehow the app cancelled the ride request, then gave me a new request with another driver (David). David called to ask where I was to be picked up. I told him I was already in another Uber vehicle. David cancelled the trip. "
210,"I have been a Uber employee for two years and have currently been robbed of 167.94 for taking a customer from Jacksonville, Florida to Orlando, Florida. I haven't received any payment for driving their customers to destination. And now I'm being told I need to have cameras put into my car to keep from this happening again. I told to buy my own cameras to make sure their customers won't lie and tell them I'm committing fraud against company. I haven't had any past record of this and now they kept me from being paid money that they owe me. Bad company. Bad customer service and horrible way to treat one of the top rated drivers in the largest landmass city in the world/ Jacksonville, Florida."
211,"I was recently left stranded by an Uber driver who canceled my pick up when he was only 1 minute away after I had been waiting for him for 15 minutes. He gave me no explanation. The Uber app automatically reassigned me another driver, but I had to cancel this one because I no longer had time to wait for another driver who was 20 minutes away. I was going to miss my bus to the airport."
212,"I’ve been driving off and on with the company since 2016. Since I have been driving in a new place, I noticed Uber is taking more than 50% of the fare. A passenger paid $7.52. Uber took $4.52 and just gave me $3. I have driven for 13 hours and not even paid $100. Majority (99.9%) of my fares never hit $7. Where I was making over a $200 a day, now it’s $60, $70 maybe $90. And don’t forget to tack on a full tank of gas which is over $30 for my car. And the maintenance upkeep that I accrue more quickly because of rideshare. I will never drive nor think about riding for or with them again."
213,Recently we went to Chesapeake Energy Arena for a concert. Used Uber because we were not familiar with Oklahoma City. The fare from our friend's home in OKC to the arena was $21.49. When we used the App to return the fare was $45.58. We had no other way to get back so had to pay the more than doubled fare. Everyone should be warned of this practice after an event.
214,"Uber advertises low price and then switch to much higher prices once they find you a ride. Their app doesn't show the new price. Their app is intentionally deceptive. When contact support they are rude and unhelpful. ""You got scammed? Sorry that's our policy."""
215,"I find ridesharing services invaluable. From a business perspective, I much prefer using ridesharing over rental cars and certainly over taxis. The convenience and cost can't be beat. I also often use them for personal reasons over driving myself. With parking rates approaching $70/day in San Francisco, ridesharing quickly becomes cost-effective and eliminates any issues with drinking and driving."
216,"Most of the drivers are unprofessional. Even in summers the A/C won't be switched on and when asked, they re-confirm if we really want A/C! The most frustrating cases are where they accept the ride, don't turn up to the location, don't call, don't pick up our calls and then choose to cancel it putting the cancellation charges on us. Other transportation options are in fact becoming better where Uber is just getting worse day by day."
217,"I will try to be professional: don't use uber or uber eats or lyft. I did all three and gave awesome clean and professional rides and all three fired me due to "" low ratings!"" I never heard one complaint from any of them ""customers"" now I am fighting to keep my car now I had for a year. I am depressed so much. I feel let down. So if you all cared about people then you would try to help with the ratings. I was hoping I would have a nice home for my family. My daughter has autism and my son with backwards repetitive ADHD and I can't do anything fun with them and my mom has health issues... wanted to help her as well. But nooo I can't now. So thanks for nothing you stupid companies who are cold blooded crooks who steal from all of us to feed your fat **! Sorry to those ripped off... I was too as a driver."
218,"I have been using Uber for years but after a bad experience this past Friday I think I’m done. After a two week business trip in Detroit, I arrived back to the DC area and found myself in need for a ride from Dulles Airport to my office in order to get my car and drive home (about 5 miles). I didn’t feel like waiting in line for a cab so I ordered an UberX. Not two seconds (literally two seconds) after hitting confirm my phone rang. I answered and the person on the other line identified himself as my driver and asked where I was. I was stunned to say the least but luckily I was already closing in on my walk to the pickup location. He asked where I was going and I told him the name of my company. He asked “Is that in DC?” To which I told him no, it is in Herndon just a few miles from the airport. He said ok and he’d be right there. "
219,Please be careful when using the Uber app. I have had to cancel the second debit card and am still waiting for Uber to refund my account. I found several fraudulent charges. Not only has this happened to me but it has happened to my daughter as well. I will remove the Uber app from my phone as it is apparent that their security measures are nil and that the customers are vulnerable to having their card numbers used for other rides. Since there is not a human being you can speak to and communication is only through emails this is extremely frustrating. I have used other ride apps and Uber is the only one I have had this issue with.
220,It's been 6 months for today. I had recharged for 1000 on Jan 31st 2018. I see that in my payment there is a balance of only 650 Rs. When I started querying Uber on my 350 Rs till date these shameless guys haven't turned up to me with a valid justification as in where that money went.
221,"Customer supports are the most incompetent people I've ever interacted with in my life. After the 8th interaction, I get a new person every time. They clearly don't spend any time reading past interactions, mention surface issues, and close the case. It's ridiculous. Account payment not working for 1 month. Changed cards, reinstalled, deleted cache => nothing works."
222,"Uber does not address fraud. I've been trying two months to get refunded for a fraudulent cleaning fee. My son rode and I paid. The photos sent were fraudulent. The help robots cannot make any decisions and just regurgitate past answers that don't fit the situation. My son gave permission for me to work the issue but even with his permission, HELP will not listen or correct the fraud from this driver. How can anyone trust a company that treats customers with a total lack of regard?"
223,They own their cars. They are clean and don't smell. They are motivated and speak to us as punters as opposed to taxi drivers who often smell and don't give a jot and often try and cheat by driving the wrong routes to bump up the fare. The taxis are also sometimes wrecks in need of repair or replacement.
224,"I have no complaint with my drivers. It's ""Uber"" in general that I have issues with. Based on my new and recent experience with Uber out of Jersey City/New York City. Changes in upfront price given, wasn't given a reason and no reason would even make sense. The arrival time was exactly as quoted with no changes in route. Only a few areas of congestion on the 45 minute long ride, overall easy ride. So why significant extra change?!...And then when I tried to find this out through Uber online support they charged my credit card almost 5 dollars each time (for a total of 25 dollars)! That's ridiculous and bad business practice. And for the 5 dollars I was not able to even send my complaint or receive any answer. "
225,"I called an Uber one rainy night in Dec, 2:30 am. The app uses (on its own) an older cancelled credit card as opposed to the one being used now over 2 years!!? Therefore app won't accept ride! There was no way to correct it!? The app not only didn't accept regularly used card it would not accept any card!!!?? It's 2:30 am, rainy Dec night, remember? I had not enough money in my account for a taxi, I walked home. 5 miles. The next day I went to the hub, I was upset. The Uber partner had a sardonic smile during entire exchange until I asked for a promo code for my trouble. Now the Uber partner openly chuckled and provided no verbal response. Uber takes very good care of their hub employees. A new rideshare company needs to swoop in take over, Lyft is not up to the task."
226,"I have a serious problem. For about two and a half months now, Uber has put a restriction on my instant pay. They first claimed this was because a customer informed that I never delivered her food. This is not true. I do not even know who this customer is. So I filed an appeal through Uber. Then I called back to follow up on the appeal, but then was told that the reason there was a restriction is because I changed my account information too many times. I asked why would this be an issue. If this is a 1099 business type, I have the right to change it as many times as I want. I have a 4.8 star rating and have been employed with Uber for about 3 years now and never had a problem. I have always represented them in a dignified and respectable way. "
227,"I take pride in driving, that is why I am quitting today. During drive time I may pick up a lawyer, a wink, a prostitute or kids that need a diaper change or a random person who doesn't bath. My cars are cleaned 5 times a day and I carry spray. So for a guest in my car to say I need deodorizer that's rude. If I am driving through a green light and it turns yellow one cannot stop in the middle of the street. There is a reason a passenger doesn't have a car. Uber never asks the driver about the passenger reports, so I am quitting. I will never give one of these passengers a ride anywhere in my car. Uber cheats drivers daily, they only hire Asian customer service reps, and the guy who works at the San Bernardino green light is a huge ** who wears a sweater and basketball shorts. If you do not drive 12 hours the dispatch punishes drivers with 2.00 fares for up to six hours. That's why they are being sued for unfair practices."
228,"I booked a ride for 7:30 AM and the driver shows up at 7:05 and calls me to come down. I politely said I would be there in about 10 minutes and that I had booked my ride for 7:30. The driver hang up and didn't say anything until the end of the trip when I arrived at the airport, only to find that I was charged a considerable (almost 15% of the whole bill) fee for ""waiting time."" How is this ok when the trip actually started earlier than scheduled, which was entirely at the driver's will? Now that I did some research, it seems that in 2017 Uber added tons of hidden fees that are controlled 100% by drivers so they had many more ways to get paid more, of course by the consumer who knows nothing all so that Uber didn't have to spend a cent more on their contractor drivers. Utterly a scam. "
229,I'm so tired of Uber not caring for me as their driver! The GPS is 90% wrong! We losing time and money chasing around customers and don't get paid for it! We have a lot of one way street in Denver and the GPS keeps on telling you to turn where you are not supposed to turn! 2 months ago I followed their routes with customers on the car and got a ticket from police for wrong turn and Uber told me it was on me! Washing their hands from their navigation problems! How can a multibillions dollars company make their money on navigation and have navigation problem??? Also they get paid the same as us driving if not more than us on rides! We have to pay gas and oil change and tires and and and... Not to mention the tear and wear that brings the value down of our car! So stop finding ways to pay us less!!! Respect your drivers!
230,Nothing but good experiences. We use Uber all the time. Airports and sorting events. Cheaper than parking at most venues. Also when my wife and I go out for dinner and drinks. We have even used it while on vacation at Disney.
231,I used Uber when I had no ride to my post op visit and couldn’t drive yet. It was a lifesaver! I got to my appointment in time and caught another driver back. It seemed a lot to spend $50 round trip but also a necessity when I couldn’t drive.
232,"I ordered a Uber for work 8/28/18. They then sent me the text message saying he would be there in 5 mins. I continued to get dress. Not even a minute after that message came thru it said he was here... so I quickly called the number it gave me and asked him politely for 5 mins. He said ok. I told him where to park. I run out 4 mins later and there is nobody there and It says I canceled the order. I then had it reordered for me receiving the same driver Richard Kia Soul **. It sent me the same message saying 5 mins. I decided not to take the chances and sat outside waiting for him for about 7 mins. When nobody showed up I tried the contact number, took me to the voice over thing. When I checked to see where he was it said I canceled again. Now tell me why would I recancel an order I deliberately just redid?? And when I contact customer service thru the app like it says they don’t care!!"
233,I've used Uber 3 times now to go local places usually 10 miles or less. All guy drivers and it’s definitely scary getting into a car with a stranger. I would call a regular taxi company if I needed a ride at night and I was alone. I don’t trust Uber to do a good job of vetting their drivers.
234,"I was very happy with Uber until my last experience when I had a ride with Uber to Kashmiri gate. When I booked the ride I was shown 188/- for my ride. As soon as driver arrived he said it is 285/- fare showing on his app. I thought it will be updated. At the end of the ride driver asked me to pay the amount showing on his app. I showed him it is 188 on my end. He said, “You can escalate it later with Uber. Right now you will have to pay 285/”. I paid it, also the receipt I got from Uber is still showing 188. "
235,I’m not huge on ride share or using anything that involves giving my bank info to a company. When using Uber for the first time I was very surprised at how competitive the prices were. Getting a ride from the casino was 79$ from a taxi and 36$ from Uber! I was shocked. The drivers are cool and do there best to make sure I was comfortable. The only bad part is the lack of rewards we can get and the discounts are only temporary and they’re given when they want to give add them to our account. And they come with restrictions. They combined it with Uber eats but they don’t offer it in my area which is a disappointment for sure. 
236,"Drive with Uber you need to get better. I currently drive for Uber but am concerned with some drivers taking advantage of people with disabilities. I had picked up a Uber customer who had a 3 star rating, which to me I thought there was something wrong but still decided to accept the ride. When I picked up the gentleman I realized he was blind. As he got in my car we had a conversation and he told me that I was the quickest pick up he has ever gotten and asked me why. He told me he usually has to keep requesting Ubers over and over. I know why. It’s because the drivers are declining a 3 star rider. I told him it was because I don’t pass up any opportunities to pick people up to get them to their destination. He was the most kindest man I have ever met and I realized that other drivers have given him low ratings just because he had a disability."
237,"Uber charged my credit card account for 220 rides in 3 days which are all incorrect, as I did not use Uber during those days. The rides were charged from the USA and The Netherlands, altogether for an amount of approximately USD 7000, - During these days, December 23 to 25, I was in a country where Uber is not active, as Uber services are illegal in that country. I reported this matter to Uber, but they will not cooperate."
238,"I have used Uber several times and had no issues until I ran into them incorrectly billing me for a ride in October 2018. I noticed that I had requested a ride to Newark airport for a colleague and they billed me the ride to Flushing, NY instead and doubled the price. I disputed the charge with my credit card company but paid them $38.00 for the ride. After that I tried to get them resolved but it is so difficult since they are clueless and have no intention to resolve the issue. Two weeks back I requested an Uber and they would not confirm the ride due to the rightfully disputed charge. "
239,"I am a senior citizen and I tried to sign up for Uber. I went to the website to create an account. I supplied my name, an email address, a cell phone # and password. Afterward, I realized I had not used the correct email address. Thus began a vicious cycle. When I tried to change the email address, it said the phone # I provided was already in use. It kept asking me to send a screenshot of my phone. I have no idea how or what that entails. I could not find a phone # or customer service agent. There was nowhere to go to complete the transaction. I ended up going to GogoGrandparent through Lyft, but I would prefer Uber."
240,"I booked a ride to my grocery store (HEB in Austin). Getting there was fine. When I was ready to go home, the app malfunctioned and I could not connect to Uber to book my trip home. I had good Internet coverage (I checked) and my phone was working perfectly fine. I just kept getting a read error message across the bottom of my screen ""Cannot connect to Uber."" (or something similar to that). I am 77 years old suffer from Stage III COPD and back injury and typically only used transportation for the disabled. I am on oxygen and was carrying that equipment, as well as my handbag and a very heavy bag of groceries."
241,"I’m really disappointed with Uber for what I feel was “pointing of a gun at my face and rip me off” at the very last minute when I needed the service the most. I had book a trip from Madrid to the Airport, I was showed a fare from low to high, I was ok with it, I ordered the service. Less than 10 minutes before my trip, I received a message from Uber saying that due to congestion and demand (6AM and Madrid was empty), I will be charge 50% or more. I received this message and at the same time the confirmation that the driver was on its way. "
242,"I understand mistakes happen but when I call customer service I expect them to be rectified. In all I was on the phone with Uber for over an hour, spoke with 5 different people, got called a liar by 2 different representatives and even got hung up on when I hadn’t uttered a single curse word. Still haven’t gotten my issue resolved and I’m still waiting for a callback from a supervisor I expect I’ll never get. By far the worst customer service I have ever gotten."
243,Uber is taking undue advantage of customers linked payment mode. My Paytm was linked with uber and I have been taking rides through uber app. One day my ride was of Rs 69 and the ride was over half an hour before and I was sitting at my home when I received message that Rs 174 deducted from my Paytm against that ride. Even after my complaint for the same in uber no one turned up yet and the pathetic thing is there is no one or no contact point from where I can get clarity. Seriously I feel like these online business are like trap for customers and please don't be fooled. Never link your bank or any other payment mode through which they can steal your money.
244,"I booked Uber drive wherein the driver who accepted my request was already on a trip which would have taken roughly 20-25 mins to complete. Thus I asked the driver to cancel the trip as it was wrong on his part to accept another trip while he was already having passengers in his car and knowing the fact that he was gonna take time to finish the ongoing trip and then reach my pickup point but he denied to do so and rather asked me to cancel the trip. I told him I would not do so as I was not liable to pay the cancellation charges for his mistake and when I insisted him to cancel the trip he started shouting and saying ""ek baar bola hua samajh nai aaya kya? Kisika noukar nai hoo 10 lakh ki gadi leke ghumta hoo"". "
245,"After a concert in the Woodlands Tx, we were headed to downtown Houston to another address. During the trip one of our passengers became ill so we decided to call it a night instead. The driver asked me to change the address in the app. I did as asked. The new address was 4 miles closer than the original destination. I was charged an almost $90 surcharge for changing the address of the trip and the driver never stated that would happen. I even tipped her $15 for the night. I contacted Uber the next day by email. I received one email back that they'd look I to it and haven't heard back since. Their Customer Service is TERRIBLE. I have asked for a refund and I still haven't received any word back at all since this happened at the beginning of July. Almost 2 months."
246,"My driver falsified my delivery, the customer service representative reiterated obvious information with no plan of action, and the manager tried to reassure me with a 100% refund that’s mandatory. By the end of the call, the restaurant I ordered from closed and UberEATS management replied, “Well, there’s other places you can order from in the area”. Absolutely incompetent company with poor standards and a lack of accountability for their actions."
247,I love using Uber. Sometimes the price is higher than the cab service and that sucks. If they were a bit cheaper I would use Uber all the time!
248,Uber is helpful to get around as we do not live near a city bus. We can open the app and see how long a ride will take. This helps the teens and seniors in our family when I am at work. It is competitive and cheaper than a taxi.
249,"Trip after Trip, overcharge of 4$ here, 6$ there, rarely did I pay the upfront price, no explanation given to why such overcharge, the only reply I get ""we evaluated your charge to be"". When I got overcharged 13$ on this last trip, again, the CS anapologetic decided to refund me only 4$ without any explanation. So that was it for me, done with this company preying on my money. Also hard to contact CS, but after you contact them, you realize it would've been better to just delete the app. Save your time and money and use other ethical alternatives."
250,"I took an Uber from the Memphis Airport to my hotel. The driver knew my name. I was told the driver's name, car color and model and his license plate. I knew ahead of time what it would cost. Everything went on my credit card. It was very easy. I felt completely safe."
251,"I had few miles missing on my trip and called customer service for help, verified who I’m to them and explained myself that I was missing few miles and ""can you please check for me."" He said, ""Allow me 2 minutes,"" said ok. He came back, ""Yes you are missing something. Allow me another 2 minutes. Said ok, come back and said, ""No you were paid correctly."" Answered him, ""No worries, please let me talk to a supervisor."" He replied, ""I just answered all your question and no supervisor available."" 4 times tried to get a supervisor on the phone. He refused. His name was Michal and I told him that, ""In America the way things works if you can’t help me I need to escalate my concerns to a supervisor."""
252,Tried to register on the website to get a trip to the airport. The website needs to be revamped so it's user friendly and does not take your valuable time away. I used the Super Shuttle instead after dealing with the bad website. Not sure why it can't be a little easier to book a trip with a car. This is ridiculous.
253,"I now live in a small town that doesn't have Uber and I miss Uber almost every day. I don't own a car so Uber gave me a safe way to go anywhere I needed, at any time at a fair price. I recommend Uber to everyone who lives in the larger cities close to me."
254,Used Uber when we were attending a wedding in CA and they were prompt and the driver was good. Driving on CA highways can be stressful but the driver knew where he was going.
255,"Please be careful when ordering from Uber Eats!!! They take no responsibility!!! They don’t work with you at all. I use both Uber and Uber Eats almost daily. I have many saved places in my phone. A friend who doesn’t have Uber asked me to order her food and I did. So when I ordered my own food I didn’t realize that I didn’t change back to my home address. I noticed this instantly and cancelled my order. Uber charged me for the order stating that I cancelled after the restaurant accepted the order!! I said, ""They do that instantly, so when do I have time to cancel my order without penalty of paying for an entire meal that I didn’t receive?"" "
256,"I have had a few great experiences and a couple of bad experiences. Worst experience was being picked up in an emergency situation when I needed to get to the hospital to visit someone. I was in a hurry and we were already on the highway when I realized the driver reeked of alcohol and was completely intoxicated, weaving in and out of lanes and could not keep the car between the lanes. The second time with Uber that was bad was when the driver made a couple of stops along the way taking me to my destination. These stops were in a shady part of town and I was scared to death."
257,"I have been using UberX twice a week, every week since July 2, 2018. On Monday morning I use Uber to go from my house in Mississauga to Pearson Airport, and on Friday early evening I use Uber from Pearson Airport back to my house in Mississauga. Every Monday and Friday exactly at the same time and the same route. Every time Uber charges me different fare, not even two times were the same or even close. Last week they decided to charge me extra money three days after my trip to the airport for unknown and unexplained reason. Uber thinks they can charge you anytime because they have your credit card information. It’s completely a rip off and totally inconsistent charges for the same trips at the same time. I decided to cancel my Uber account and use regular taxis or Lyft; no more Uber anymore."
258,After continuously reminding that i was charged more by the driver i have not yet got refund nor yet any customer executive is assigned to this matter. It's been four days. I have not received any mail regarding it. It's really difficult to contact Uber as there is no direct call center for customers complaints. We just have to write on Uber help or support but dont get any response from them. I know writing here also will not sort my issue but it's just ridiculous.
259,"I used Uber last year and loved the service. I again ""attempted"" to utilize Uber last night (Halloween) for my 16 yr old daughter. Guess what? She ended up stranded miles from home due to YOUR inept incompetence. Needless to say, our Uber days are over. BEST TO BE AVOIDED/NOT CHILD-FRIENDLY! We will be utilizing Lyft from this point forward. Choose your merchants wisely!"
260,"Newer vehicle, clean, owner was professional, dressed well & most courteous. Very knowledgeable of area, knew routes to avoid traffic congestion. Polite, helpful, on time and excellent driver. Will continue to use UBER."
261,"So my husband and I thought to let everybody know about our experience in New Orleans with Uber. We will never take Uber again. We went on vacation to New Orleans to take a cruise. We arrived the day before, The suggestion from our travel agent, just to make sure that nothing went wrong. We are new to Uber and our ride from the Comfort Inn Suites at the New Orleans airport to the Port of New Orleans on Feb 7 was the first time using Uber. This was at the suggestion of the Comfort Inn Suite and we were happy with the service that was provided to the Port of New Orleans. Mileage of 14.34 and drive time of 36 minutes as recorded with a value of $21.78. "
262,"Girlfriend ask me to send her an Uber, so l ordered the economic or pool which US$3.30. l provided the exact address of my girlfriend which was going to ride to my apt. Well after a while UBER sent me a text that the ride was canceled by driver, and also to try one more time with another driver. Well l tried, so finally succeed, but the driver could not find the address l provided. He went to another address, but finally reached the destination provided. l called the driver and he told me that he was sent to another address, but the address l provided was accurate. But as l said before, finally reached my girlfriend and brought her to her destination. "
263,"I buy gift cards for my son and he uses them quite often. I have had problems a couple times, but it is usually on my end. But when I call for help, they are great. They handle it very quickly. He has only had problems with a couple drivers, but other than that both of us are very happy with the service."
264,I was in Montreal last week as it was raining. Wanted a quick ride to my destination so booked an Uber. The amount displayed was between 27-35 (which included surge). I didn't mind it as I was running late and wanted to get to the destination on time. Unfortunately there was an event taking place at the location and the cops had blocked some of the roads - due to heavy traffic and roads being blocked it took me 50 mins to get to my destination as opposed to 20 mins and to my surprise at the end of the ride the driver told me there is waiting time added to it which I wasn't aware off as Uber doesn't tell you the amount right away. You don't have the visibility as you do in most cabs. You can see the meter and make a quick decision of either taking the ride or stopping it right away.
265,"I like Uber for the most part. Their prices fluctuate (increase) frequently. There is no phone number or email to get in touch with Corporate. You get charged when the drivers go to the wrong place and say you aren't there. You get charged when you cancel but you don't get anything when drivers don't show and there is no way to make this known. For the most part it is ok but, these are things that have happened to me or family or people I know."
266,"It’s very clean than yellow. Driver too. Car is spacious than yellow cab. I don’t have shake a hand to catch a yellow cab before, even bad weather. They come to my place directly to pick me up, and I go Long Island, no extra charge."
267,Car was dirty inside and the air conditioning did not work. The price was fine but I expected a much more desirable vehicle. I am glad there wasn’t some with me because the back seat was full of clothes and sports gear.
268,"Company responded, states charges won't go through. But the scheduling portion of the Uber app does NOT work."
269,"I am overall very please with Uber. The only complaint I have is, now prizes depends on the time you are traveling, if is rush hour, or very early mornings fare is a lot higher. I have felt safe all the time riding them. Very professionals and friendly drivers."
270,"I have been a driver with Uber for the last two-and-a-half years. I have been through thick and thin with him and their customers doing bad things to me as a driver. I stop driving for them for a while and hope that things would change. They have upgraded the app so I tried to start driving again. They wanted a new picture of my license. I've uploaded it over 10 times, sent to them multiple pictures and they keep on saying poor image and then they won't approve it. And when I call him they have excuses on all its poor image. Part of it's always the same thing. They will never let you talk to a supervisor. Never let you talk to a manager. They never let you talk to anybody in charge. There's always people laughing in the background. They don't have no respect for their drivers and whoever is going to drive for them. They just need to stop because Uber won't back you up."
271,"I took an Uber to my home recently, while my car was being serviced. My criteria when rating a ride: Timeliness, Cleanliness, Vehicle Condition, Driver Navigation & Friendliness. All of these were met, & the driver was very pleasant as well. I gave him a ""5"" star review on Uber's app. (I also tipped him $4.00 on a $12.00 ride) On these merits, I'd definitely recommend taking Uber. However, I do have issues with Uber charging me two days later for a ride I didn't request, or take! I am requesting a refund, But still.... I shouldn't have to argue with Uber Reps when they're at fault."
272,"Uber has been nothing but a headache since I started working for them. I take a 1 hour drive and they take the money away from me saying that I picked up the wrong person from a specific household to a business. Please tell me what the likelihood of me picking up someone from a house and go in one hour away to a business and we picking up the wrong person is.... Oh you say it makes no damn sense, yeah you're right. Smfh. Uber takes no time whatsoever to do any sort of investigation not even an email to find out anything at all from the driver. They just send an email saying that they took your money and you wasted your time. This is not the only nonsense that I have had to deal with. A customer broke the handle of my car and there was a huge run around with handling that. I will no longer be driving with this unprofessional company and I will be taking legal action."
273,"I have noticed that drivers are not dressing as professionals; even though, they would like to be praised and tipped for their service. What has happened to the dress code? Ladies, you come like you have just finished cleaning the house, messy hair; men, you come in t-shirts, jeans... I will be considering the competition when I need a ride."
274,"I ordered delivery via UberEats. My order came missing many items and when I called the restaurant they were very apologetic and offered to refund my money. Since I paid via the app I had to contact Uber customer service to request a refund. Not only did Uber refuse to give me a refund, even though the restaurant agreed but they would not even bother telling me why. They simply did not respond to my follow up emails asking why I could not get my $27 back. This is the worst customer service I have ever experienced. I will never use Uber or Uber Eats again."
275,"I ordered an Uber. Price estimate was between 27-35$. I ordered Uber, and they charged me 73.00$. More than double the price estimate. There was no traffic. I took that route multiple times, at different times of the day and the maximum charge for the trip was 38-40$. Now 73.00$. I wrote to them numerous times, but they gave me silly explanation and never refunded my money. Definitely they should not charge me more than 35$. They have your credit cards, and they think they can charge whatever they feel like it. Someone has to look at what Uber is doing."
276,"I recently had a missing payment on 3/11/19. I contacted Uber and was told to submit a bank statement with deposits before this date and after this date. I got the paperwork from my bank and submitted it to Uber. Uber claims that there was a technical issue and the payment was pending. According to Uber, the payment was deposited into my account successfully. The only problem is that my bank says otherwise."
277,"Never again will I use Uber. While in Vienna, Austria we took an Uber to the city center from a Marriott. The return trip from the city center was a disaster because the driver (Suzana) took us to the wrong Marriott and would not take us to the correct Marriott. She made all 5 of us leave the vehicle. We are 5 women, all 70 years or older, at 10:30 at night, in a foreign city, in a dark and isolated area. We had to get a taxi to return to the correct Marriott. Personal safety is not a concern to Uber and that in itself is a crime."
278,"I downloaded UberEats for the first time today and received an error message while trying to place an order. The help website was totally useless and I place 3 calls to the support line. During the 1st call I was told that I needed to delete my credit card and reenter it to fix the problem. That did not work and the support representative in the 2nd call told me I was in good standing but should try an alternate card. This did not work either in the representative. In the 3rd call told me to email support to get a higher level support person. Uber responded to my email by telling me that my account was suspended due to ""suspect appeasement"". I have no idea what that means, but needless to say I have decided to use a service that actually wants customers e.g. DoorDash."
279,After ordering an Uber for a ride to the dealership to pick up my truck the Uber confirmed receipt and was headed to me. The app showed the Uber waiting on me at the pick up but no-one was there except for me. All of a sudden the app showed that the driver cancelled the ride and I was charged 5 dollars. I again ordered another Uber and disputed the charge which they refunded. The second Uber ordered done the exact same thing but I was refused refund. I will never again use Uber and I have downloaded the Lyft app for future use.
280,Uber is great. I went to a convention in New Orleans and the wait time was good and they were reliable. The cars were clean. We had no issues. I used Uber many times over those 4 days. I recommend Uber.
281,I've been through so much with this app and it's only negative. I've had so much patience trying to deal with this company but nothing gets resolved except Uber taking my money. I bought $75 in Uber gift cards to get a $72 ride. They didn't allow me to use the gift cards and asked me to add a card. I followed instructions to do so. I had an active card but it kept asking me to update my billing settings. I KNOW everything was correct. For HOURS I WAITED IN THE COLD trying to figure out how to get one ride.
282,"Suddenly Uber is adding an extra $2.50 to your ride. They call it a surcharge and when you complain try to explain that perhaps the driver paid a toll, even if the driver arrived within 2 minutes (literally) of your call. They are doing nothing more than taking more money and offering nothing in exchange. They want as much of your money as they can get their hands on. Beware. They'll call it any name they can think of. Tolls? Not. Surcharge? Definitely. More money in the Uber coffers. Rider beware!"
283,"Living in a new area where public transportation is limited, this service is a life saver. I don't own a car and previously lived in a more urban area where I could walk to most places. I can pull out my phone and usually get an Uber in less than 6 minutes."
284,"Yes, Uber can be convenient, but beware. As a digital company, there is NOWHERE passenger can go to complain about rude and incompetent drivers (and there are plenty) Or to get a refund when you've been ripped off. Further, a driver can accept your trip and then leave YOU STRANDED and not show up if he gets a better fare. This has happened to me numerous times! Then he gates paid $5.00! AVOID Uber if you can at all. Use some other form of transportation. It is not passenger-friendly."
285,"I usually have good experiences with Uber. Drivers are pleasant and cars are clean and on time. My only complaint is the extremely high rates at peak times. I had one trip where it was $60 to the event and $315 to return home. Obviously, I had to find another way to get home."
286,"No show. Never again. Airport. Uber booked for 0815. 0810 driver cancelled. 0815 booked another. 0840 driver phoned - can't find the address. 0850 driver cancelled. 0855. Panicking. Tried again. 0915 Uber arrived, not mine. Driver said would cancel client and take me for 30 euros."
287,"My driver, Rohan was nice, but when I tried to add tip I noticed that he had switched my $9 9am fare in French Quarter to someone else's 2pm trip in Metairie for $28.00! UBER refused to acknowledge. 5 attempts to rectify problem and received nothing but irrelevant automated replies. If you get in the car with Rohan in NOLA and he says he can't get his system to work, it's a a SCAM. Terrible customer service from UBER with zero relevant assistance after 7 days of requesting corrected bill. BEWARE."
288,We use one credit card for Uber. We do not use this credit card for any other transactions. Our credit card was hacked last night. Thanks Uber for your outstanding anti-credit card theft program! Not!!!
289,"I have always used Lyft due to negative info about Uber. After receiving an Uber gift card I went to Uber.com & checked balance. Uber not only downloaded $100, it advised I have an account under my email with a wrong phone #. As I tried to enter my REAL # a message stated that phone # was already associated with an account. I have received 10 emails from Uber that all ask for snapshot of phone # & sim info and NOTHING has been done to correct this problem. I have done everything possible to resolve this & at one point was advised Uber is not accepting cash gift cards! This is ridiculous, put the $ back on the card since I have already had to spend $45 using Lyft!! I have also reported to the BBB."
290,"I started driving Uber September of 2016, during that time business was good was getting lots of rides. I completed over 5000 rides in 2 years while maintaining a 8.6 rating. But lately Uber has really has gone down hill. Less riders because everyone drives now, pay has gone down considerably since they take 25%. But what really broke the straw was yesterday I drive in Chicago and have to do Uber pool rides, a rider complained about there was 4 people in my car! So she was first rider then 2 people jumped in and pick up 1 more person. I apologized for the inconvenience, I was very kind and social, the ride gave me 1 star because of something I have no control over how many riders in my car."
291,"Cherry picker???? Asks you where exactly you are going after he picks the order, asks if the lady is going alone, calculates if it is good money and company, then cancels the trip if it is not. You cant review him since the trip hasn't started, so he has pretty nice rate level. Happened to me, not sure how many people he has innocently questioned like that and cancelled the order."
292,As Uber driver in North California. This is second time happen to me in within six months. I got a text message from Uber says they identified improper use of the app as a result they remove my promotion from my earning period and will deactivate my account if similar problem occur again. I talk to support customer service. They send my case to an expert and after waiting for 36 hour for their reply and demand them to explain to me what mistake I have done in order to avoid doing it again because I really care about my job as Uber driver. They seem to be careless and sent me same message. They send earlier like robot message.
293,"Don't expect Uber to show any care/concern for you, even if you are a long-time customer with a disability. My husband and I were both screwed over by customer service over things that were clearly Uber's fault. A couple of weeks ago, my husband was denied a promotion for a week because Uber ADMITTED that there is a lag in their system, and it didn't update in time for him to take advantage of the promotion. Even though customer service admitted it, they refused to credit him in any way and just said too bad!"
294,They are prompt and courteous and if not for the prices I would use them more. It would be perfect if the price quoted is the price charged. It's confusing when it says $7 and they charge more than that when you see the bill.
295,"I read the Reddit forum about Uber and am very concerned about what I see. Murders, rapes, fasle charges, non-show. However, I can not determine how much of this is false. Never-the-less I am concerned about the safety and reliability of Uber drivers. My personal experiences in using 6-8 trips has been great. As a senior who drives my car only 500 miles a year, I see Uber as a great money saver. If/when I am unable to drive and/or give up my car I will definitely use Uber or Lyft."
296,"After working for several months in an area without Uber, I returned to find the Uber had several large ‘pending charges’ on my account. As we are in the process of closing on a house, making sure our accounts are straight is critical... Yet there are the Uber charges soaking up funds without ever going into a status to dispute them. Uber rather unhelpful ‘help’ page says these charges are necessary to verify account. Normally, these charges are pennies... Not the same amount as a ride (for each of several ‘verifications’)?"
297,"My husband and I use UBER or Lyft frequently when we go out because we don't want to drink and drive, even a little. We moved a little over a year ago so now our average ride is about 25 minutes since we aren't as close to where we go with our friends. Without a doubt, at least the driver going there or coming home makes a complaint about the drive because they would like to stay in the busy area and just do a lot of short drives. It makes for a very uncomfortable ride. I even had one complain the whole time and then make sure I knew there was now an option for tipping. I tip almost all of the time but when I am made to feel uncomfortable because the driver has to do their job and drive me home, just farther than they would like, why would I tip that driver?! We all have things about our jobs we don't like but your main job is to drive."
298,"If your son/daughter uses Uber - beware. My son recently used Uber and was charged a $150 cleaning fee. The driver submitted pictures taken from someone else's ride, and claimed the mess was made by him and his girlfriend. He contacted Uber to refute these charges, and told them to check the date and time on the picture. Uber said they didn't have that information. Apparently they believe whatever their drivers tell them. He went back and forth with Uber. Finally, I sent an email and told them the driver would have that info, and we would seek legal counsel if necessary. They soon refunded his money. On a Google search, I found out many Uber drivers do this. They often set up their car to show a mess, use the same pictures over and over again, and even have a bank of ""messy car"" pictures they submit. My advice - take pictures of the inside of the car before you leave."
299,Uber is very helpful for me as I feel safe knowing that someone could track who I was riding with and where I went. So person would have to be very crazy to harm me under those circumstances. I also don’t have to have cash or give my credit card to an individual. The vehicles are much nicer than any taxi that I have ever ridden in before using Uber.
300,I am beyond frustrated! It has been approximately 6 months or even longer since I first tried using the Uber app and received a message that my account I has been suspended (or whatever word they use when you cannot get into the app). I have taken the requested steps by Uber to get this glitch fixed probably 10 times already!
301,Today I booked a ride from I.D.A pharmacy. Driver was waiting in a different lane. When I finally found the car and sat in the car. Driver started arguing with me. He said that he is canceling the ride and I need to book another car. If I got get out of the car he will call the cops. He forced us to come out of the car. He came out of the car and was standing at the door until we came out of the car. How can someone cancel the ride and threaten us like this. Drivers get paid because of customers and this is how drivers behave. This was the worst experience as I was waiting 10 mins and he canceled the ride. Driver's name was Sherif and his cab number was ** Ford Focus. Trip was canceled on 20th oct 2018 at 1.28pm.
302,"I suppose my 1st; emotional review was rejected by this site because it was anonymous. Too bad because people say all truths with 1st story. So because they decided to support Uber and not post my real-life experiences, hear it a filtered narrative. I work for Uber but before I worked for Uber I was a passenger. Uber - Passenger: Uber is pre-installed on ALL androids because some politician was paid and lobbyist got this approved. This is probably why this company gets away with so much **. Uber is a technology and is run from Philippines or India with some fake headquarters in California. I called the California attorney general to issue complaints – THAT HOW I FOUND OUT."
303,"My name is Clarence **, I was currently a full time Uber driver, Uber decided to deactivate my account which was my bread & butter for more than 13 months straight, I have a 4.90 Uber rating and I have drove more than 4800+ folks with awesome compliments, my bills which included car payment and insurance, rent and etc. My car that I financed a year ago was strictly for Uber, now I'm on the edge of losing my car and other things that matter. Please can someone help me as Uber has deactivated my account for a annual background check, I've been working for Uber for over a year and I have passed the requirements to become a Uber driver, so my question to Uber is why? Why me? And I've still haven't gotten a good response and I've been telling them about my bills and situation and they seem not to care."
304,"WE love to use UBER, all of the drivers we have had are friendly, timely and are great drivers. I only rated the safety as a 4 as I hear lots of things occurring regarding ""fake"" UBER drivers. There has to be a better way of identifying the driver you are meeting. They are getting better and a lot has to do with the passenger as well."
305,Uber delayed response to keep their drivers & customers safe is ridiculous! May 18th is the date that uber has made mandatory for both driver and customers. What were Uber thinking and what were they waiting for months have pass and people are dying every day! No excuse for their lack of responsibilities..
306,"Was a little nervous to use but after I did, I found that I felt very safe each time, very polite drivers, clean cars and felt very comfortable. I was impressed."
307,"I was in San Francisco last weekend. Between my sister and myself, Uber cancelled on us 8 times. Where is the credit for them cancelling? This was a big problem because they didn't cancel right away, so several times the car icon was getting closer and then turning around. The drivers we did have were very nice but most of them had no idea about the directions. One even got out and ran across the street to ask someone. I'm going to switch to Lyft."
308,"My account has been blocked for no reason and without warning my Uber stopped working one day, and while I have been using other platforms, I have emailed them several times, I sent them my ID and the cc they asked for, I have contacted them through the app and Twitter and they keep passing the ball to each other and don't respond my questions or emails and 3 weeks later nothing has been resolved and no answer to my emails. Terrible service from such a company. I also learned that is illegal on of the countries I visited so won't be using ever there."
309,"I bought a new vehicle for making money driving for Uber. I’ve been driving for 6 months with a perfect rating and no complaints. When I renewed my rego and updated details with Uber they tell me I can’t drive for them anymore. My car had a 5 star ancap rating and this year they gave a 4 star rating, so that’s it. I can no longer earn a living due to Uber's ridiculous red tape."
310,"I scheduled a driver for three hours away, for when I needed to go to the airport. One showed up immediately, and then charged me a 'cancellation fee' for not being packed. Uber said they would cancel it. But they only gave me a credit toward a future ride. They refused to refund it, as any ethical company would do. So they made a big profit of $6 on the deal. Because I do not deal with unethical companies. Lyft is just fine."
311,"On 6/22 at 2:45PM I took an Uber. The driver (""Salaheddin"", who was a much larger man than me and could easily have removed me from his car) claimed that I was drinking in his car in the middle of the day and spilled it all over his seat. I demanded Uber refund the money and they showed me a picture of a cup with some liquid on it, and a car seat cover with some liquid on it. Probably not even his car."
312,"I ordered on 12 March-19 at around 12:40 PM then order confirm and then after 15 mins I received delivery boy contact number so I called him but his number not reachable and after 5 mins it's showing on the way, then again I called him but still not contacted then I called customer care. One executive received my call (VIKAS). He told me, ""Sir please wait for some time. Order is on the way and I also tried to contact with delivery person, but it's not contactable so please wait for some time."" "
313,"We have used Uber several times. Some are very good, some ok, and one awful. All have been punctual. But the quality and cleanliness varies. The awful one was smelly and we almost had an accident within two minutes. He ran the stop sign. The car was dirty and smelly and if we hadn’t had to be on time, we would have gotten out. The best one was an immaculate SUV. It looked brand new even though it was about 7 years old. The driver was polite, cautious, very neatly dressed. He had free water in front and in back and little cups with candies in the cup holder. He was a real professional and made the last leg of our trip a pleasure."
314,"I somehow put my unlocked phone in my pocket and ordered an Uber to a place in my town that I’ve never heard of. I typically dig Uber but this was insane. I had no upcoming trips showing so I couldn’t tell that it was even ordered to cancel it and then I finally clicked the car and it gave me an option to cancel. Why didn’t it just show in my upcoming trips? Anyhow I was charged $5.00 to cancel a trip I didn’t even order, and because it wasn’t showing in my ‘upcoming trips to cancel which is how that should have appeared when I went to cancel it. I suggest Uber use fingerprint technology like Venmo and additional applications so these things don’t happen in the first place."
315,"My mother had a ride on 7th May through Uber App and she left her mobile in the cab. After that we are continuously trying to connect with the driver Satendra, who didn't responded to our calls and he immediately switched off the phone... We had immediately reported this incidence to Uber and after their responses, I personally feel like Uber himself trained them for all cheat happen with their customers, everytime just their automated responses were coming no one bother to understand the pain of Senior Citizen Female traveller, moreover, I have wrote an email to uber CEO, and found he is too least bother about customers and their issues. I won't anyone suggest to opt Uber henceforth, they are not reliable."
316,If you wish to have a good job to deliver food and make money from Uber and thank that it will go well. Well you are very wrong towards on getting paid and all. They have repeatedly lost the money that should of went into my bank but didn't. Well also accuse me on driving concerns towards on safety and riders. Well they don't even have their stuff straight because I'm a cyclist that delivers food not driving. That's what I also got fired for because of driving. So if you just love job abuse and losing your money it's just the best place to be. The whole job is completely unorganized and full of liars.
317,Rarely on time often never showing up. Insult to injury? They still charge your card for cancellation after they failed! There's also the issue with the app often taking the consumer out of their way for additional charges. Then there the back and forth to determine what went wrong.
318,"I have been dealing with an ongoing issue with Uber since 12/23/19. An Uber driver confirmed that I left my phone in their vehicle and that they have my phone. However, they have been no responsive since then. I've tried multiple times to reach the driver, Uber Customer Services and even CEO Personnel, but to no avail. Now Uber customer service sent an email today saying that the driver doesn't have the phone. Many would interrupt this announcement as pure theft on behalf of the drivers part. All I want is my phone back. I have one more day to go here in Las Vegas. In addition, I just want someone to hold the driver accountable for his actions!"
319,"If I could rate this experience any lower, I would. This was my first and last trip with Uber. My credit card was charged $33.60 for the trip to my destination, and $113.62 for the return trip. I contacted Uber and they would not refund the overcharge. This is certainly no way to run a business and no way to treat their customers. Terrible experience. Next time I will call a cab. Attached are photos of my receipts."
320,"Requested an Uber from hotel on the beach to the airport, about a 45 minute drive. While I was waiting I noticed a car similar to the one I was expecting pull up and three people jumped in. Waited a little longer and then noticed that I was on my way. Someone else had taken my ride. To add insult to injury I couldn't request another Uber until that ride was done, and I got charged for it! No response as yet from Uber, I wonder how long it takes for them to respond. The driver obviously didn't verify who he picked up."
321,My Uber is not working. I send email for customer support as it's the only way to contact.-- They keep sending email back to me send me the phone number picture from your phone screen. -- I send them 15 times.-- Again they will send me the same email. I am not able to log in my account-- and they dont care. It's kind of sad.
322,"We used two separate Uber drivers, one on the way to a concert in downtown Austin and the second driver took us back home. Both drivers were safe drivers, their cars were clean and comfortable, and they readily adjusted their thermostat in their car to accommodate our comfort level. The second driver that picked us up from the concert was able to get very close to the arena exit doors. We did not have to walk very far at all to get to his car after the concert. He was there waiting when we walked outside so we did not have to wait at all for him to make his way through the traffic to pick us up. Overall both rides were a good experience."
323,"Down in Orlando Florida it was the first time I've ever used the company Uber. The app made it easy to use the service. Let me first tell you it is very very fair, fast, clean, well respected individuals that we used."
324,"On 1/9/2020 at 05/25 pm I booked on Uber and was accepted a trip to the ER at a local hospital. I asked the driver twice about his whereabouts and twice repeated my location. At 05:34 he (not me) canceled the trip. I was charged a $6.00 cancellation fee. Because the trip was canceled it does not show up in ""My Trips"" and I am not able to challenge this charge. I have found no way to get in touch with Uber otherwise."
325,"If you need a ride right now everything is fine and works perfectly. The problem starts when you need to schedule a ride for later date/time. It is practically impossible to do. I figured after all this years in business they have ironed out the software and killed all the bugs, I was very wrong. For example if I am at location A now but my friend is giving me a ride to location B in 2 hours, then in 3 hours I need a ride from location B to location C, the software blindly tries to match my current location and gives an annoying error message about the location!! Is this so hard to fix? “We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard."" John F. Kennedy. Rice University, September 12, 1962."
326,"Driver picked up my 17 year old son who left his phone in the car. Driver tried to get cash out of my son to bring the phone back, but when he realize he had none he charged my card the $15 returned item fee and never brought the phone back. A police report has been filed. Uber has been no help. Last message I got appears to be automated. If a real person wrote it they absolutely did not read my prior message. In discussing this incident with coworkers my Dr told me her husband was extorted $100 for a new iPhone's return after a night of drinking. I'm going with LYFT and going to be damn careful when I do."
327,Its overall service was great. The only major concern is lack of interior cleanness. Almost all of the cars were dirty and filthy as all window and door handlers were not clean (full of finger/hand oils).
328,"I gave Uber my condo community gate code. They did not come to my door. I decided to wait at the gate. I hauled 2 large duffle bags, a carry-on and a backpack to the gate. I'm 72 years old, it nearly killed me. The driver was late. He said he doesn't enter gated communities. I didn't get my ""within 10 minutes"" discount. Next time I'll call a cab."
329,"When at Sky Harbor airport, I called for an Uber that indicated a fare of $38 from the airport to my home. When I looked at the fare, it was $72. When I try to dispute it, all they say is that this was the fare that I agreed to pay when I booked. That is completely false. But, who thinks to screenshot the fare before booking. But besides that, Uber doesn't even allow for input of the dispute. They force you to claim something like ""the driver took the wrong route"" before they go and review. But the driver took the correct root. The charge is just wrong - there's no way to dispute. I will never use Uber again... EVER! Thieves!!!!"
330,"My husband and I just got back from a walk home after never being picked up by our Uber driver. She ignored our calls and shortly after canceled our ride and we got charged. This is not the first time this has happened to us since moving to Orlando. We have been putting two and two together with the Orlando area and Uber drivers. We have discovered that people put in for rides, rides show up close by but never pick you up and then either, you cancel or they cancel, either way you get charged! What?! This is crazy, we have used Uber for years and this is unexceptionable. We will not waste our money on a company that doesn’t regulate their employees to pick up people or have any record of them ignoring calls. I guess it’s time to try a new company like Lyft. Change needs to happen in Orlando, I am not the only one with concerns."
331,"I ordered a Uber Jan 8th 2020. I saw the driver drive right past me and go to the block one block over. I texted him that he just passed me and to come back. I confirmed my address and he said no such address. Well he was wrong. He cancelled the trip and I got charged $5.25. And I saw the driver go back past me on his way out of the area. I scheduled another uber and he found me just fine.. The uber app was in error sending the driver to the next street over. The driver was in error for not answering my texts. And UBER corporate was wrong in denying me a $5.25 refund... USE LYFT INSTEAD, I DO NOW.... AND UBER IS IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTACT..."
332,"This was the most terrible trip I have had with Uber. This is not acceptable as an Amex platinum member I should receive top notch service as per the Amex platinum/Uber partnership program, and this was anything but that. My driver was completely lost and did not know where to go as I was only attempting to get to the airport. He says his GPS did not work and even mentioned that he hates Uber and always tells customers to choose Lyft instead. As a result I arrived at airport 25 minutes late and missed my flight. After complaint to the company for this instance, Uber did nothing except offer to refund the ""extra money"" that was unexpectedly charged due to the additional distance because of the driver getting lost. Listen to this Uber driver employee and use Lyft instead as I will going forward."
333,They don’t care about safety. I was a driver for Uber and they all time send me 6 or 7 people and my car only 4 people. When you tell the company this not good for the car and not safe they say cancel the trip. When you cancel the trip they get mad at the driver.
334,"The second there is an alternative to Uber, I will use it and never, ever look back. What you have to go through to get the app, your personal information/payment options and the experience to work is tantamount to abuse. Their technology must be designed and maintained by 7-year-olds or someone with that level of arrested development. All of a sudden, Uber starts denying my payment methods and asking me for new ones, when there is absolutely nothing that has changed and perfect financial integrity on my end. New payment methods are NOT accepted. ""Customer service"" is a cat chasing its tail and there is no phone-based help available(!) Unequivocally the worst internet-based service in the history of the internet, or phones for that matter. Take a taxi!!!"
335,"I would like for everyone to be safe for the holidays and also I wanted to share my HORRIBLE experience with Uber Atlanta Uber/Lyft Drivers United. So I was headed home from work and I rake a Uber from the train station and the Uber driver got ready turn in the neighborhood. And I told him this is the wrong neighborhood and Uber driver tells me, ""I’m following the GPS"" and proceed to go in the neighborhood and pulls up to a house that was also not mine. I then told him once again this is not where I live. And moral of the story I end up having to walk home and I will no longer be riding with UBER. They are unsafe and drivers don't care about your safe. I have continua to report my issue and they did nothing about us and thought a 5 dollar credit would solve the problem. I am terrified and very scared to after my multiple horrible experiences."
336,This past Sunday we took an Uber from LAX to Fullerton CA which normally is between $40-$50. This time it was $114 plus tip! The reason was high demand but the airport was not crowded and traffic was light. We are switching to Lyft. Bye Bye Uber.
337,It’s absolutely horrible experience and felt systematic loot by the corporate whose tariff not controlled by any government authorities. Neither they care for our laws. The charge for Goregaon west to CST RAILWAYS WAS Approx 1000/- INR WHEN I GOT DOWN within 2 km they charged me 230/- as penalty. Is our government protecting our right and controlling unethical business practices of UBER? Disgusting.
338,"At booking, I was given a price range of $13-17 (similar price to exact trip taken the previous day at the same time). Accepted, met with driver on time...no difficulties, no construction, no additional stops. After trip completed, fare charged was increased to $23.25. I was not informed by my driver that my rate had increased, nor given a reason why by customer service, despite several requests for a simple explanation. Misleading and unethical business practice. I used to trust this company, and used them exclusively...but their decision to perform and defend this bait and switch tactic gives me reason to give my business to their competition. Thankful for the lesson."
339,Uber is on so fast haven't had any issues with the company or any of the drivers. I'm always nervous getting a ride from someone I don't know but that is why I count on the Uber company to research the people that work for them...
340,The cancellation fee should change because if a driver is 20-30 minutes away I would like to cancel because I need someone closer and you can’t see how far away the driver is until you confirm the price and that’s when you see how far away the driver is to meet with and you. And in most times the cancellation fee is taken out even if you don’t meet with the driver and you cancel the fee is taking out the app show $0.00. And when you check your debit card account it show that it has been taken out so sometime needs to be done or changes to the app and service!!
341,I have been a loyal customers for a few years. I take several Ubers a day spending roughly almost $ a month. I have two jobs and mistakenly put the address of the wrong job. 2 minutes into the ride I realized I was going to the wrong location. Instead of going right he went left. I told him to let me out (okay with being charged being that it was my mistake) but when I told him to stop he rode faster to the destination making it completely unsafe and dangerous being that it was also raining this morning. He left me at my destination leaving me all the way on the other side making the fare that much higher. I had to pay an additional $15 to the $7.63 I had to pay for the last one.
342,"Convenient, but not happy with 'peak' rates; hate drivers who rely so much on GPS; once had a driver go wrong way down one way street in NYC; hate the pressure to give 5 star ratings for experiences that are good but not great."
343,"The driver has submitted a claim for $150 through the app. After calling him through the Lost Item option on the app and confronting him about it, he claims he has no idea what I'm talking about and that he's ""too busy"" for this. His claims are false and fraudulent, and I will NOT be held liable for a fraudulent scam. I will be reporting this company and your driver to the police for fraud. I will also report you to the Better Business Bureau and raise hell on any and every social media site known to mankind. "
344,"I booked an Uber Ride in Geneva, Switzerland on 8/24/19. The ride did not show up at the address I specified. I was charged a cancellation fee. I ordered another Uber Ride and again they did not show at the address indicated. I was charged another cancellation fee. I made one final attempt and this time they got it right. I felt the drivers in Switzerland were horrible compared with my positive experiences in the US. I would highly recommend not using the Uber service internationally. I filed a complaint about the cancellation charges and they indicated that my credit card would be refunded on 8/25/19."
345,"The first (and last) time I ever used Uber, the fare estimate was $61. When I logged on to book a car, I got a screen that looked like upgrade options, the lowest of which was $89. There was an option to ""Skip this Step"" so I did. I never got a screen telling me my total or asking me if I agreed to book it or not. Just that the car was on its way. The car that arrived was a huge SUV that could probably seat at least 8 people (I was alone and had one small piece of luggage and a backpack), and when I looked at the receipt later, I saw that they charged me $150 for this unnecessarily huge vehicle. When I wrote them about it they claimed I submitted a different destination location, which is entirely untrue. And they were so cold as to not even give me a break as a 1st time user, refunding at least some of that outrageous total. Terrible company in my experience."
346,"I traveled to Orlando last week with 3 other adults. We were picked up from the airport in a Corolla. Three adults in the back and one in the front. The ride was uneventful and we were dropped off about 1 hour later. I received an email from Uber on our 3rd day of vacation stating that they were adjusting my rate by $120.00. I was confused so I sent an email thru the help app. I was informed that I was being charged a cleaning fee of $120.00 as our driver reported we made a mess of her car. They then sent me pictures of what looked like vomit on the driver side rear floor, door and seat. I was shocked."
347,"We booked a ride from Suffolk County to Brooklyn in the early evening on Saturday and was charged $142, which is not totally unreasonable. However they charged $251 to return back again because it was later on Saturday and they know they can charge more due to more folks needing rides after going out. They take advantage of folks in less than a cohesive mindset and this practice should be considered gouging and discontinued."
348,"I requested a driver to take me about 25 miles. The stated fare was $42.07...reasonable for the long distance, and I have a pass which discounts the trip afterwards. I watched on the app as the assigned car drove around about 3 miles away...then received a request to rate my trip, all within about 5 min of requesting the 25 mile trip. I figured the driver must have cancelled or something and requested a new trip. The second driver came and drove me to the requested destination. Same distance, same stated fare, no problem. I noticed later that I had been charged for both trips though. I know mistakes happen, so just messaged Uber to request that they refund the trip that did not occur. "
349,"Usually I travel to DFW airport daily for my job. Yesterday I rented Uber just as I do everyday. My driver was Glorelys. I am deliberately writing this review in order to educate consumers and since Uber has monopoly is U.S. and they feel nobody or no review can harm their reputation. This, Glorelys was new immigrant from Venezuela. I just don't want to discriminate, but because of my experience I asked her when did she moved to U.S.? She didn't know a single word of English. She was talking in Spanish with me and authorities at the airport. Though I was guiding her on right path, she didn't heed my advice since she didn't understand English. She roamed around airport for 1 hour and Uber charged me $12 more than usual charge. I was late for my job. Instead of giving me refund, it charged more for driver's fault. "
350,Uber is a great option when traveling or other times you don't have a car available. Fare is reasonable and drivers are polite. I have never had any concerns when using Uber. I will continue to use it especially when traveling rather than renting a car.
351,"In my experience, Uber Drivers always show up on time. I never have to wait long and they are always pleasant. The vehicles are clean and roomy, when needed. When traveling, the drivers are always helpful and they give recommendations on great places to eat and different sites to tour."
352,Uber has really been difficult. I would like to use my account to order food but the number associated with my account is almost 5 years old. I haven't had that number in AT LEAST 3 years but they will not allow me to change it because according to support the only way to change it is through the app. So I download the app and enter my number but obviously that doesn't work cause it's not associated with my email. It is however associated with the driver account I attempted to make but there was no email associated with that account because the process was not finished.
353,"I tried to get an Uber last night. Waited a while and was notified driver can not be found do I want to continue. I selected no. So I walked a MILE after an 8 hr on your feet, walking the entire time shift in over 100 degree weather to catch the bus. To wake up finding Uber charged me for a ride I never took. The app asked if I wanted to continue. By selecting no it should have cancelled. I even went back into the app and the app has no past details of any record of me taking a ride. SO FRAUDULENT"
354,"I try to avoid rideshare if possible because of the uncertainty of when the vehicle will actually arrive. The arrival time keeps changing as other passengers are added to the list of pick-ups. The last time I used ride-share, I waited about 20 minutes for a car to arrive."
355,Only use it in town. Would not use alone to airport or long distance if I did not know the driver. Locally the drivers are really nice. I like the idea of having an account with Uber so no problems paying.
356,My Uber app will not now work for me. I have tried going through the Uber website but it tells me my phone number is already in use and cannot be transferred to another account. When I went further on trying to get help it told me ‘we received this email from a different email address than the one you initially used to contact us. Please contact us from that email address.’ Emailed begging someone to call me to no avail. Uber does not have a number to call. So frustrated! Guess Lyft is now my transportation.
357,"Riccardo, Honda Civic, license plate ** in Los Angeles was to pick me up at LAX. Waited only 5 minutes and he texted me to confirm where I was going. He said he would be there in a minute. He pulls up 20 ft from me, and as I walk out from curb he just takes off. I texted him saying, ""Where are you going?"" He said, ""I don't want to take you"" and then charged me a $5 cancellation fee despite he's the one that cancelled it at the last second. Riccardo you're a jerk. Your Uber profile states you drive because ""Need clients to support myself and loved ones."" Such baloney ya loser."
358,"I use the service at least 5 days per week and generally get excellent service. And when there has been an issue the Co. has made thing right. My only complaint is that it is difficult to communicate with them, especially if it is a complaint not listed on the frequently asked questions"
359,"I ordered food, and it was supposed to be delivered at 6:55pm. At 7:10 the driver, Tariq, contacted me that he could not found my address (5 min from the restaurant), already on Uber website. I gave him some instructions on how to find it, and he told me I gave the wrong address. Another 10 min and he call again that he was lost. When I try to help him, he told me that he could not waste any more time on my order, because he was losing money every minute. He told me that he was canceling my order. I called the restaurant, reorder the food, and went there to pick up. I was parking on the restaurant when the Uber driver calls again, at 6:40, telling me he was in front my house and I wasn't there to receive my order. I lost it. I told him to feed the food to his dear mother and leave me alone. What a bad experience. I will never order from Uber again."
360,"Uber is the worst service provider. There is no way you can reach them for any support/complaints. Because of their low standards and no customer care in place, the drivers are their own bosses and are not scared of any misconduct and unethical behaviour. You guys really need to have a strong and reachable customer service in place. I have been trying to report an issue since the last one hour but no success so far. Pathetic! Ola is anytime a better option."
361,"The driver incorrectly the wrong pick up time and also the wrong drop off location. This prompted me being overcharged and UBER is refusing to provide a refund for BOTH mistakes. They claim to have ""dealt with my poor experience by dealing with the driver"" but will not give me my money back. They just lost another customer for $7. DONE USE UBER."
362,"Uber steals what little drivers make and puts the money in their fat pockets. Doesn’t even come close to making minimum wage. Uber is too busy stealing from drivers while reducing their pairing. They control your earnings and steal 40% waste of time, money and gas. You’ll drive around more looking for trips than you would actually driving passenger. If you complain Uber retaliates. Uber has made numerous changes to drivers earnings while they collect all the profit including the pools that should count multiple passengers towards your quest. Instead only counts as one trip. You make less than minimum wage and isn’t even worth carpooling to work. Drivers are going on strike for a reason because Uber steals from them. Waiting two hours for a passenger nothing. It’s not even worth it carpooling to work."
363,"I correctly entered in the destination on the app but when the driver arrived he couldn't take me because he showed my pick up location as the destination, on his phone. So he had to leave without giving me a ride. I canceled my Uber account immediately and got Lyft, which completed my ride. Uber has no personalized customer service for their customers. It's all robotic ""check item below that best describes your issue"" then read the advice. THE WORST ONLINE-SERVICE COMPANY IN THE WORLD."
364,"I ordered an Uber around 1130pm on July 20, 2018 for a 4.6 mile drive that would normally take 10 minutes. The regular car said it would cost almost $17 and the rideshare option was between $11-12. I opted for the cheaper option to save some money. The app told me the driver would arrive in 5 minutes, I waited in excess of that for the driver, fine. I get in the vehicle and settle in to look at my phone to see the fare jumped to $14.06. I agreed to one fare and Uber charged me over the agreed upon fare. Not to mention the driver drove so slow as if he was waiting for another pickup along route. I arrived to my destination much later than expected. He would stop at stop signs and wait half a minute before moving, it was past midnight at this point and there was nobody on the road. He also drove a route that was slightly longer than another. "
365,"Uber have no customer service. If something goes wrong, too bad. My driver got lost, went a long way, and through an unnecessary toll. I was charged $10 more than I was quoted on the app when I accepted the ride. I contacted them on the app and on Facebook and they said nothing was wrong then would not respond to messages. I used to love Uber! Now the amount I’m charged often doesn’t match the quote and ends up being the same or more expensive than a taxi. I’ll be going with taxi and other ride share apps in future."
366,"Needed a ride to Sky Harbor airport, set up my ride online, got my confirmation info. Driver was on time and a super easy person to converse with. He made our trip to the airport easy, comfortable and very enjoyable."
367,"I was quoted for a short trip. I was picked up late. The driver was super impolite. And to top it off, then charged me almost twice the quote and said there was an INEXISTENT toll paid, where there were no tolls at all in a 5-7 block drive into an airport from where I was picked up. The quote was from exactly where I was picked up to drop off in the airport so no other additionals were due. They ripped me off. I will never return to them EVER. I asked to be reimbursed and they did not."
368,"We ordered an Uber to take my 2 year old to the doctors because he was sick. We ordered an Uber. Waited under a tree trying not to get wet as it was pouring outside, windy, and freezing cold. The driver Luis ** passed by us while we were huddled under a tree and drove 2 blocks down the street. When my husband explained we have a baby and he needs to come back he told us no. He wanted us to walk 2 blocks in a thunderstorm, rain pouring down the streets because he didn’t want to turn around. Uber is charging us a cancellation fee for the driver.... HE DIDN'T DO HIS JOB!!! I’ve requested a refund back but they still haven’t sent it. It’s not the money I care about. It’s the principle that this driver Luis ** does NOT deserve money for a service he didn’t do."
369,"Customer service is absolutely terrible. I have recently been locked out due to some background check. In the middle of a fair mind you. I recently relocated to a different state and have a different driver's license. The old state driver's license was still active in my account but due to it no longer being a valid license, and I supplied the new one, the background check failed and now I have to wait 7-15 days for a resolution."
370,"I have used Uber and always had a great driver and no problems. However, the safety of it does freak me out. But it's JUST like a taxi right? It is a great way to get around especially on vacations! So is the taxi. I'm not sure why I feel more comfortable in a cab without knowing the driver than an Uber. Maybe I've just watched too many TV shows."
371,"I been using Uber for a while. I had to go grocery shopping and the trip from my home to the grocery store. Stopped on the way to mail my rent out. Put it in the outside box. The trip was like 1 1/2 miles. I was charged 9.99. BUT my ride home from the grocery store, they charged me $33.00 and change. What a ripoff! Same distance when I was going there. I wrote them and complained and they wrote me telling me they weren't giving me any kind of refund. That is so unfair. Yes, big ripoff!!!"
372,I let bygones be bygones and move on with life.
373,"Our driver never showed up and Uber cancelled our ride, not us. They charged us a cancellation fee for them cancelling. When I disputed it they would only credit it on future ride instead of refund back to our credit card. Why am I only getting a credit on account instead of a full refund to my credit card used?? This is not right what you have done when it was a Uber error."
374,"As a driver you are always wanting to protect yourself by having a dash camera to present evidence for any allegation, I had to file a police report with the Philadelphia Uber hub Office for not submitting my - camera footage and even possibly performing negligence by using my - camera footage with my customers and myself in inappropriate ways. When traveling with any company such as even uber. When they have no way of protecting the customer or driver to reassure nothing happened that was illegal or immoral there is a security concern. "
375,"Disgrace! Food delivered an hour later, stone cold. Uber takes no responsibility and refuses to answer simple questions, e.g. at what temperature the food should be delivered. HORRIBLE customer service, no reimbursement and no support post purchase. AVOID, AVOID, AVOID! Use other RELIABLE services!"
376,"Feedback about the booking fee. Recently Uber started to charge a so-called booking fee, claiming that this is to support one of a sudden safety initiatives. What am I getting from your safety initiatives? Just another trick to charge customers more. Would love to see the list of Uber initiates they currently do for passengers. Also, there is no transparency about the fee. It should be added to the estimated cost of a trip before a customer orders rather than in a sneaky way of adding after the fact. Just very frustrating because such a reputable company like Uber make its customer feel like fools."
377,"Received an Uber gift card, so I downloaded what I thought was the Uber rider app. I started to complete & realized it was the driver app. Customer Service was nice, but you can't talk to anyone, I called the 800 number. It's all done through ""chat"", which to me is the poorest customer service there is. To delete the driver account I would have to delete both driver and rider account (which is automatically set up with driver account??). Customer Service rep told me they can disable the driver account to keep the rider account with my current email address, otherwise I will have to use a different email address. This makes absolutely no sense to me."
378,"Hi, in August 6 a request a Uber XL from my house in Pasadena to Newport Beach. They send me a Chevrolet Suburban black. Very nice car! And my trip was $133. 4 days later I request the same type of car to come back to my house in Pasadena. They send me a Mitsubishi Outlander old suv small, I text the guy letting him know that I need a bigger car cause I have a lot luggage, he say, ""No my truck is big."" We say, ""Ok let’s see when you get here,"" when I saw the car I tell the guy, ""No I need a bigger car,"" he rush to put my luggage in his car and make the car full and we can’t put people in that car, we ended filling everyone in my other car, when I ask the guy how much is this trip he say he don’t know, I look in my app I can find how much will be this trip, when we arrive at home he left and finally I see how much they charge me!! I can’t believe!! $504 dollars!! Are you kidding me???? "
379,It is a good service but the website or app has very little on questions from users. It is very difficult to see if the service is good or not through the website. You need to try it first and the service keeps on changing without notice. Which in some ways is great but no upfront info or call in to talk to.
380,"I don’t have a car and grocery shopping can be a real headache. I’ve called Uber to get home. I’ve asked the driver to help me carry in my bags - they always do, graciously - and I give them a good tip and rating. It’s a win-win!"
381,"I use the Uber app to schedule a ride for 11/19/2019 at 7:00 a.m. On November 19, 2019 at 6:45 a.m the Uber app canceled my rider. Then they tried to charge my credit card for 42 dollars for a ride they cancel. I make the appointment on November 17, 2019. I’m glad I have a car where I had to drive myself to my appointment. I will never request a ride from Uber again."
382,"I've read many of the positive reviews and while I have had great drivers with Uber I've also had very bad drivers. It they are bad drivers and you think you can do something to get them removed from Uber think again. That's not going to happen. Probably the worst situation is lack of language skills with Uber drivers around NYC. Here is a case in point. I'm standing in pouring rain. Call an Uber says it will be 5 minutes. 10 minutes later I get a call from the Uber driver in serious broken English which took me about 3 times of asking ""What are you saying?"" "
383,"On 2/22, I rode from my office to my home 7 miles in 10 minutes and was charged $35. On 2/25, I summoned the same service for the same trip and was quoted $58. The driver said the trip was 14 miles. I said to follow my normal 7 mile route, which he did and arrived 10 minutes later. I asked Uber to review the charges and refund the obvious erroneous overcharge. They said the fees are final because they are within the estimate. I asked them to explain why the estimate was over 50% higher than the same trip from three days ago. They declined to make any adjustment, basically saying, ""We told you we were going to screw you and we did, so stop bothering us."""
384,"I had been using UBER since 2014, and had been happy with the services until the beginning of 2018. In the beginning of 2018, I would try to request a ride through the UBER app, but for some reason, the request would get denied and there was no explanation at all on the app. After months of trying this, I reached out to UBER a few times through my account and through their Facebook page. When they responded via their Facebook page, they stated that they will send an email to me to my email address. When they sent their email to me, it stated that my UBER account was suspended, but did not state the reason behind it nor did they state the time frame of the suspension. I was never made aware of the suspension until this email was sent to me. "
385,I have had bad experiences with Uber drivers & especially Uber Eats. Many of them don't show up or cancel even though the web ( google) shows they are here! I have read that some actually cancel & eat the customers food! I use another service now.
386,"Uber lies, cheat, steals, cons, tricks drivers. They kept dropping the pay from 1.80 a mile last year to 70 cents. That is on average. They do not even pay for gas while they charge Customers a minimum of $7.00 and pay driver $3.00. Driver pays gas costs. Drivers went from wondering if they are ripping you off. To them telling you the $3.00 dollar is an error in the system. But 1 year later, they still do the same thing. But now, it has all changed: Uber is now blatantly criminally robbing drivers. "
387,"Great personable driver, very clean car. On time knee he knew the area well. Offers further help. The price was excellent. I have been thinking of doing it part time. Definitely will use again for a night on the town."
388,Uber charged me an additional $42 for a ride to Laguardia Airport. They would not correct my fare because they say I changed my Destination from Delta Arrivals to Laguardia airport. Idiotic and the fare shows my added charges as return tolls over the GW bridge!
389,"I've only used Uber once but I had a good experience. They arrived on time, took the shortest route and got me to my destination. He was very pleasant and friendly."
390,"Not a regular user of Uber but the five times. Uber it was convenient, safe, and reasonable priced. Much less than a DUI and paying for airport parking."
391,"I am police officer. I book Uber for CST to Kalyan 23/09/2020 11:30 am and he is not talking properly and my wife along with me that time also. He is using bad words. Is this uber drivers do nonsense thing and when I am telling him, ""Just cancel the uber if you cant come here,"" then also he is doing arguments. Please respect to police. You know you uber just doing driving job and Police they Are 24/7 at police station. Mr ** uber driver. He is very bad person, He dont know how to talk with women and police officer. I am request to uber please remove him from uber driver. Car no **."
392,All the convenience of a taxi at half the price. They are there in minutes rather than the unknown taxi ETA. They are always friendly. The cars are usually clean and smell good. I don’t ever use taxis anymore. You can schedule a day and time to be picked up too. And that’s very nice.
393,"I am a part-time UberSelect Driver-Partner, working in Montreal. Recently, Uber made some changes to the categories of Rides, adding UberComfort and UberPremiere. I contacted the support through the app, to inquire how come my 2017 Audi A4, a luxury sedan, isn't eligible for those rides, especially since I have a nearly perfect score of 4.93 stars, and all I have been getting is the worst ever run-around, completely ignoring my requests to escalate to a Team Leader or a Supervisor or a Manager/Director in my area whom I can ACTUALLY SPEAK TO, and they keep copy-pasting replies that make absolutely no sense whatsoever. I guess they're all the way in India the support team, because they can't even comprehend basic English."
394,"The Drivers have vehicles that are unsafe. Either picking you up in a car that has been wrecked, driving on spare tire or smelly cars. The drivers try and be courteous but they drive too too fast and unsafe."
395,"I urge you, do not use Uber. They are well known but as you use them please be sure to look closely at what they are charging and when they are charging. I strongly emphasize on the when. They charged me on a ride I never used even after I said they are not authorized to. I have record of the trip history as canceled just 2 seconds of calling for a ride and they blatantly ignored it. Never addressed that this was an unauthorized charged. 90 days after this trip, I was sent an email 3 days ago from them stating they will charge me because their system made a mistake. Shortly after this, I figured out that their loophole is to close the account 30 days after your trip so you cannot dispute it then send a notification 90 days later saying their system made a mistake to a ride that will be charged 14 days later. "
396,"Uber's customer service is beyond horrible. It's been three weeks and I still can't get them to reset my account. Someone answers after three emails maybe. Then they ask the same questions. And then never respond again. If you have an issue, don't expect it to ever be solved. This isn't my first encounter. My previous company stopped working with them as a business client because they never responded to any of our emails."
397,The most advertised company Uber Eats has worst application and the order procedure where they don't let the customer to cancel the order but reflects on guidelines to ask on support where the customer support also keeps on wasting time of the customer during the procedure so that they can charge the price of order and then cancel it. Happened twice. Customer executive name: Saurabh.
398,A few years ago I purchased the Uber app as advertised using the $20 in case of an emergency for myself due to my situation. I had no transportation and still don’t today. I was at a doctors appointment In Sanford Florida behavioral Center for my depression. The nurse took my blood pressure and pretty much gave me a lecture due to my new high reading. I was able to see the doctor right away due to it being an emergency for having a stroke any second that day. I couldn’t go to the emergency room because I tried to use your app I was looking forward to due to my emergency however it never worked out other than I lost $20 for something I was never able to benefit from due to my situation that shouldn’t have been an issue. I realize Uber was just getting started at the time. I only wanted to bring it to their attention. Thank You.
399,"I had to pay for a ride I did not get!!!! Charged 3 times, I paid for a ride 1 way 16.00 then for a ride back home for 15 min I paid 50.00, then for a ride I did not get but was charged 14.00, Uber drivers. Get very little, Uber corporation is taking most of drivers' money, this company is a total scam, they will not refund money back!!! Should be shut down!!!!"
400,"Apparently, it must be an easy way for Drivers (and Uber) in the Miami, Florida area to make a quick buck without working, as I was hit with not one, not two, not three, but SEVEN bogus charges within the span of 2 weeks. The game apparently works like this: you request a ride, the driver accepts the ride request, the driver gets near the pickup spot, cancels the request, charges your card for the cancellation (hoping you never notice the charge), then goes on to his/her next victim in the area."
401,I got this guy and he charged me and never came. He blamed the GPS when I gave him clear directions then when he finally saw us he drove off and canceled the ride charging me $13 and still charged me plus a $5 fee for driving around. What a scum bag. Spread the word so people know. I don't want this happening to other people I want you all to be aware of what some Uber driver are doing. Be careful and always check your online receipt because they are ripping people off???
402,"Headed to the airport, Uber asks me to confirm my phone number. I do, and they ask me to enter a 4 digit code that I never receive. I contact customer support via the app (there is no phone number), and they ask for my phone number, a screenshot of my phone number, and my last few trips. They contact me almost 2 hours after submitting these details to ask for these 3 details again. I sent this info again, and they reply with a similar message. I type everything out and take new screenshots of everything, and they once again ask me for my phone number. I finally ask, ""Is there any way I can continue using your app, or do I have to use a competitor going forward?"" 20 hours passes. No answer. All I want to do is use the app, all of my info is the same, and has never changed."
403,"Horrible experienced. I lost my personal belonging at one of theirs Uber car and I have emailed helpline with all pictures of the lost item and drivers details. But just because trip has not been booked from account no one is going to help. I spoke with phone helpline supervisor Angela and she told me clearly that she will not get in touch with driver to ask about my lost item just because the trip has not been booked from my account besides that I have all necessary drivers and trip details. Angela told me too that Uber doesn't have complains email, how convenient isn't it. Well I think it's time to start use other apps as this days Uber is getting too expensive and as you can tell does care about their passengers and their belongings as they are only an agent."
404,"I have been driving for Uber over a year, no complaints. I got an email from Uber saying there was fraudulent activity on my app and I might be disqualified, but they didn't say what the violation was. I tried repeatedly to get an answer via phone and email, but just kept getting a form letter asking for a screenshot of the problem. They are not even reading the question, just firing off the same form letter. Impossible to communicate with. Very unprofessional."
405,"I have used Uber for a while now frequently during the week. Recently, upon returning from a two week holiday, I get back to business as usual and my usual route has a price hike from $12.50/$13 to a whopping $27.98 for an UberX. Also, two days in a row I’ve been charged more than the price shown for the same route I’ve been taking for months! Uber May be fine for “New Users“ and folks that aren’t frequent riders. Otherwise, prepare to be ripped off. I'm done with them. They lost my business."
406,"I moved back to Huntsville, Alabama in May of 2019. I had left in Feb, 2019, and moved to Florida and then Dallas, Texas. I had tried ""Uber"" in Florida and Texas and did pretty well. When I returned to Alabama, I uploaded all of my new driving requirement documents and was held up on one particular document, the 20 point inspection. I went to a certified mechanic and paid for the inspection and my 2017 Camry passed with flying colors. ""Uber"" denied it. I was shocked. "
407,"Automated messages that never resolve the issue or concern. Days of waiting to hear back in the form of a text. No phone numbers listed. My account was hacked, credit card info, personal information stolen. It started out with my account being hacked. I notified Uber and they said my account was linked to my son's and maybe my son bought $600 worth of food delivered to 10 different home across the country. Bizarre reasoning I've ever heard of so I did. I checked with my son and he did not have access to his account because... IT WAS HACKED."
408,"Uber Events no show. Let me start by saying I LOVE Uber. But Uber event didn't work, my guest were unable to use the ride I offered. Also I have no way of contacting Uber to get answers. I have searched online with no luck - support shouldn't be this hard!"
409,"I took a ride on Sunday evening and didn't touch alcohol that night, absolutely no incident happened inside the car that night. Today I am being charged 150$ for a cleaning service!!! Drivers are scamming customers, making up stories so they can get extra cash. Uber should be ashamed of the service that they have been providing. It's very unethical and embarrassing for the company to keep people like that."
410,"We used UBER in Romania, excellent experience, we did not need to use TAXI, bus, rent car, the UBER arrived withing maxim 10 minutes and we knew the status within seconds how long time we would need to wait."
411,"I will never use Uber again. I submitted a complaint and received a $5 credit, before even hearing what my problem was. So I sent this: ""I received an email yesterday regarding this and it said I received a $5 credit. I would like more than that and most importantly I would like confirmation someone looked into this man’s license. I would never want someone to go through what my friends and I went through, while trying to be safe and responsible. I have also not told anyone about how horrible this guy was and how many times I felt like my life was at risk."
412,Unfair fare policies! Uber doesn't even disclose money charged for each Km! And are not willing to refund for example for charging exorbitantly high 300/- for 1.75kms!! Am a more than 5 year old customer with Uber!!!!
413,"Fraudulent promotions - I wish I could give them a ZERO rating! I’ve had many problems with Uber in the past. This time it is it!! NEVER AGAIN! I signed up a new rider using my link and I was suppose to receive a monetary credit toward future rides. They issued it in Taiwanese dollars!! Does that make any sense?! When I emailed them 3x, same generic response, you can’t use Taiwanese credit for your fares. Umm I know! Then why did you issue it?! I didn’t use, apply, or signed the person in Taiwan!! Seriously the worst company and I don’t know how they still get away hiring criminals as drivers!!"
414,17 days after my ride I was charged $150.00. I got sick in the car because of the long ride and the way he drove. I made sure nothing got on the car! Why did I get charged so much for cleanup??? I understand a 40-50 charge but this is totally absurd. Now my total is $180.00??? Do not use as they can charge your credit card later whatever they want to charge and whenever there is no standard. Or deactivate your account after the ride. I saved no money using Uber. It’s very difficult to contact support.
415,"I tried to add my daughter to my Uber account and ran into numerous problems. I am in CROYDON, PA and my daughter is in Philadelphia PA. My daughter needs the Uber getting back and forth to work. We have messages that the payment needed changed, invalid payment method. There is no customer service # to call so I am dealing with a friggin robot. Robot says they lifted restrictions off my account. My daughter tries to use Uber again and gets a, ""Oops something went wrong!"" Only good part is I can curse out the robot and not get hung up on. Uber needs a customer service representatives, not robots to have any satisfied customers! Uber is a big joke!"
416,"I have only used Uber. 90% of the times, service has been excellent, car are clean and drivers are friendly and pleasant-mannered. Other times car are dirty and drivers are smelly. Next time will try Lyft."
417,"Yesterday our Uber driver mistakenly went into a parking lot with security to pick us up even though our pick up point was over a block away. Security wouldn't let us in. The Uber driver only texted in a foreign language. Then he cancelled. Uber says their policy is even if the driver arrives and then drives past miles away, you have to pay a cancellation fee. There should be a class action suit."
418,Just not good. Try to book a ride to the airport and the app say something about invalid payment method with American Express. So bad trying to resolve the issue and still not being resolve. Better get taxi cap.
419,Had a Uber car pick my wife and self from 701 S Olive Ave Florida from ride to airport which is 10 minutes away. The fare posted was $7.55. The driver put in a false claim for spilled coffee in back seat. Absolutely false and attempt to claim damages from us. Car was clean when we entered and left. Wasting time having to communicate with Uber.
420,"Although my driver was excellent the price Uber quoted $63 was $102 when I checked my account. The driver told me, although there is traffic, the price is the same. That’s not true. Instead of 45 min. It took longer and fees are added. I will never use Uber again. In Quebec last weekend the same thing happened. Delete the app! Uber charged almost double a regular taxi charged for the same ride."
421,"I booked an Uber ride and the driver immediately accepted the trip. The app showed me that the driver is very close to my starting point, but I could not find him anywhere. Then within seconds I received a notification saying that I am in the trip and will arrive at my destination soon. But I was still waiting at my starting point waiting for the driver to arrive. I wrote to the driving asking him where he is. No reply, and I could see him moving towards my destination."
422,"Everytime Uber makes an update it inconveniences its riders more and more. The update to the GPS has caused so much confusion for me and my drivers. Most of the time the address takes me to the back of the building I ask to go. Also this new Uber pool walking thing in the middle of winter is a horrible idea. The whole point of us using Uber instead of riding buses is so that we can get dropped off and picked up at our door not walk two blocks in the cold. And you shouldn't have to pay extra just to avoid walking, I've had drivers cancel either way so we were better off without that update. Uber used to seem to care more about its customers, I wish it would go back to being that way. I've been riding Ubers since the beginning."
423,"A little over Two weeks ago, I was a rider in an Uber that go into a car accident when it hit a concrete divider in NYC., myself and my friend were injured and required transportation to the Hospital. We both have several injuries that require medical follow up, my friend suffered from a hairline fracture of her skull and Spin, I have several injuries ranging from concussion to neck injuries as well as knee injuries. My Doctor wants me to get follow up care ASAP but to date Uber has not reached out to use to give us any information. We have tried to contact them multiple times and get a RoBo response that they are taking this issue seriously but nobody has contacted us or given us insurance information. This leaves us in a bind in that we cannot make Dr. apt. without the no-fault insurance information."
424,"I set up an Uber account in June 2018 for a trip scheduled to Seattle. I used the train system instead of Uber, however, someone had used my account several times in foreign countries and edited my personal account. I’ve tried several times to reach someone to cancel/refund my account but keep get redirected to use the “help” link within my account. I’m unable to communicate through the help link because the person whose edited my account has access to it! It’s crazy. I’ve sent a message through “Get Human Services” for Uber to contact me immediately and provided my cell last week - still no follow-up. Uber has no customer services value and clearly shows it. I’m appalled at their lack of services that get so much national exposure/marketing. All I want is to have safety of my personal information and stop others from using it. Be aware of your potential risks before signing up."
425,"Driver picked up my sister, Dee, at my house. Her destination was clearly noted on my Uber request. (About 10 miles in a populated and popular area of the city.) Dee is two weeks from being 77 and is unfamiliar with my side of town (suburbia) and has a difficult time walking. Later I learned the Driver had driven around my neighborhood for about ten minutes (in the totally wrong direction of the named destination)."
426,A driver cancelled my trip yet I got charged. I tried to call Uber to request a refund but got no response. I decided to report to Paypal who filed a case ID# ** on my behalf but Uber has not responded. The only response from Uber is to provide details with a screenshot of my phone number. Unfortunately the suggestion for a screenshot is not working on my device. I do not want to feel cheated by a company I use regularly.
427,"I like that you can see exactly how much the ride will cost before committing, so there is no chance that a driver will drive all over town to raise the fee. I also like that I have never had to wait for more than 15 minutes for a ride. Tipping is optional, but I usually tip."
428,"Uber have drivers going to areas needing a lot of rides, offering promotion and not paying!!! When you call to inform them they make up rules other than the initial ones. I have been cheated twice!!! They don't provide a way to legitimately complain, putting people on the phone that you can barely understand. They do not care about their drivers!!!!"
429,Worst support provided by the Uber. They don't have a customer care number and not responding on mail as well. Whenever they want they block the account without informing to customer. Also on mail they didn't provide any reason why they block account every time.
430,I am very impressed with the overall concept of the Uber and the dependability of service. Drivers are personable but not overbearing; courteous and intuitive - every customer does not always want to interact or converse.
431,Firstly Uber uses an outsourced call center to receive and take calls for their company. The employee I spoke to was a supervisor by the name of JOHN who was in the Philippines. He did not care about my concerns about my safety. They are unconsidered with their employee’s SAFETY. The driver is unaware of who they are picking up or even where they are going until the rider gets in the car. I have had questionable riders get into my vehicle and ask to be taken to areas that’s did not feel or look safe. Ubers only consider is making sure you get the rider to their destination and not how to protect its drivers from harm while driving. This company should really evaluate the safety for not only their riders but their Drivers as well. 
432,"Uber has no method for allowing users to establish accounts with phone numbers that do not receive SMS messages. As a result, none of the apps I downloaded will work, and I cannot request rides. Their helpdesk has not responded to me with any useful information."
433,"Hey Uber, you need to train your drivers better. I hopped an Uber to the NOLA airport with my husband yesterday and the Uber driver took off while I was trying to get into the car. Fortunately, I still have all of my toes."
434,"I ordered $50 dollars worth of food, the delivery was 5 minutes away, but the driver drove past my house to deliver someone else's food so it took 20 minutes after pickup for delivery. The food was not edible so I tried to cancel the order. I tried to return the food, but neither the burger place or Uber would refund or return the untouched slop they delivered to me. They have horrible customer service and mislead their customers by not advertising ""all sales are final,"" they should be closed down for fraudulent practices."
435,"As a new sign up, I was advised that once I complete 60 rides I will be given an additional $350 dollars as a bonus. This was not the case. Apparently the agent explaining the details missed to clarify that $350 dollars are guaranteed for the first 60 rides. In other words, if the total for the rides do not add up to $350 dollars, they will pay the difference."
436,I drive for Uber/Uber Eats. Whenever a situation occurs and support is needed the headache begins. They are completely scripted responses. They do not actually respond to the situation but instead say it will be looked into. They then email days later and again give a script response. Never actually addressing the questions or issues. Very difficult for both customer and drivers. With customer service being what it is I would suggest avoiding Uber.
437,I made an order through Uber Eats. After waiting around for the driver who didn't respond my ordered was cancelled and they kept my money. Avoid ordering through them at all costs. They will keep your money and not deliver services.
438,"All the cabs provided by Uber in India are extremely dirty and have a horrible stench settled in them which mostly comes from the drivers. The mats are literally matted with cakes of dirt and the seat covers are almost always stained. To top it all the drivers are really unprofessional, they refuse to come up on the pickup point and if they don't feel like executing the ride, the driver ends up calling the rider and asks them to cancel the ride. Hence lowering the rating of the rider. I have had extremely bad experience with Uber at multiple times. I have been dropped in the middle of the road by the drivers just because they didn't have an internet connection to check the maps. The drivers are racist as well sexist and on many an occasion have passed very rude and vulgar remarks."
439,"UBER rude driver in Montreal. A driver, retained by UBER App to service our inquiry, called and asked where I was heading (This seems against UBER policy). As soon as I answered him in good faith, he hung up on me and then cancelled my trip. The App arranged for another driver that carried the service. This resulted in a longer wait that was not necessary should the driver have acted fairly and professionally. We wrote and complained with UBER, who just acknowledged receipt of the complaint without further actions... What we expect is a good service, and proper remedies when issues happen. This does not the case."
440,"We called for a Uber and after booking told the driver we have a dog to let him know before he came. The driver was fine with it and said ok. The following day got a charge of 150 dollars more than quoted. You try to ask for help from this company and it’s like asking your 4 year old daughter for help. This company is the worst. I’ll never use them again. I would give negative stars but can’t. Completely ** company, never never use."
441,"Uber drivers in Honolulu, Hawaii are charging passengers extra and they have to pay them via Apple Pay or cash. Tried contacting Uber to talk about this issue. Asked for a supervisor and they gave me the runaround. I want to let people know what Uber drivers are doing. Don’t know if it is just in Hawaii or other places. I had to choose one star but if it was up to me it would be -5."
442,"My husband and I decided to take the train going to LA Union Station and take UBER to Convention center for my citizenship oath taking. We don't want to be late for my appointment, it's very important, but unfortunately we contacted 3 drivers, but it seems that the 3 drivers can't find us, but we put the right address where to find us and suddenly it seems that the drivers cancelled our rides and on top of it Uber charged us twice for $5 make it $10. Hello Uber? I will never ever use Uber, very disappointed!"
443,"I booked an Uber ride (Feb. 1, 2020) from Elizabeth NJ 08206 to Perth Amboy NJ 08861 and they showed a fare of 59.00 and I had made this trip in the past for 13.00 or a max of 21.00 depending on the hours. I changed the destination to my old address in Keasbey, NJ 08832 and I saw the price drop to 13.00 then I changed the destination to 3 blocks away from my home, and the price drop to 13.00 again. I knew something was wrong. Then I decide to take the ride and walk the rest of the 3 blocks since there is no way I can make it for 13.00 or at least 21.00 to my front door. I explained to the driver the issue, why I have to pay so a big difference between my home and 3 blocks away. The driver then drove past my house and I asked him if he can drop me since my original destination was 3 blocks away and he was driving right in front of my house. He stopped and I walk a few houses to my house. Then came the bill. $ 60.00 bucks. "
444,"Uber uses every trick they can to get you out of every penny. It’s sicking. The customer service suck, or lack thereof. The company doesn’t even have a number for the riders to call. I was charged for two different rides that I never took, this was three days ago and I still have not heard from Uber. This company needs to be checked. Our country has checks and balances just for scam companies just like this!"
445,"I had left my phone in an Uber car whilst away on business in San Jose in April, I am yet to have a satisfactory conclusion to my dispute. I went to my hotel room and got my tablet device and went to the Uber website and logged in however, couldn't do anything without an SMS verification which would be sent to my phone which was in the car, so pointless. I downloaded the Uber app on device but couldn't operate anything there. I even logged onto Samsung website and attempted to force my phone to ring but it was out of power. The only way I could get hold of Uber was by writing on Twitter at how bad my experience was and they asked me to private message. I then explained where I went from and to and the times and took a snapshot of the email receipt for the trip. "
446,NO MORE UBER FOR ME - they steal your $$$. I had called for an uber last week and the driver went to the wrong location. When I told him I was at the building behind where he was he left where he was and then cancelled my trip so I had to request another car. The same driver then picked up the trip and I asked him if if he was coming since he just cancelled my trip. No response. Driver also showed up without a mask! A day or 2 later I see I got charged $5 wait time/driver canceled fee. I contacted uber and they refused to correct this issue. After going back and forth in texts and emails and getting nowhere (Their canned response stated that I had requested numerous price reductions and refunds in the past - LIE) I had to contact my credit card company to dispute the charge. I will use LYFT from now on!
447,"My friend referred me to open an Uber account, and I received a C$10 promotional discount. I took Uber from Pearson Airport T1 to Dufferin and Steeles area on May 19. The upfront price was C$30.78, the final price was C$37.66, and I took screenshots of both. I wrote to Uber and attached the two screenshot pictures. I was advised by Uber that there is a C$2.75 for booking Fee, and C$4.50 for Airport Surcharge, and Uber replied as follow: ""The estimated amount of the toll or surcharge is included in your upfront price before taking a trip. On this trip, your actual route included roads with tolls or surcharges that were not accounted for in your predicted route and your upfront price was adjusted."" "
448,"As a former UberEats driver this company has HORRIBLE customer service and most of the representatives cannot comprehend English. They take you around and around asking you the same questions over and over again and they have no respect for the drivers, though they love issuing apologies without solving your issues. They have constant issues with their app and as an UberEats driver your trips REGULARLY go missing and you have to fight tooth and nail for your missing money, IF they even solve it. It sucks when your trips go missing because you then lack proof of the delivery unless you screenshot your trip (which is ridiculous to have to remember to do for every trip) which makes speaking with their unprofessional representatives even more difficult. "
449,I've made the same journey multiple times. On one occasion I trusted Uber to reflect my pick up location rather than my position when I requested the ride. When I request the ride the quote given is around $48 but usually from my pick up location it's about $11-12. They refunded $10 for a change in route. Here's all my journeys below showing an obvious trend with - hiccup on this mentioned ride. The help desk keeps blaming price rises but that's a 350% price rise!!! 6th March at 1803 cost $11.77. 4th March at 1808 cost $48.22 but they gave me $10 back. 4th March at 1041 cost $11.19. 28th February at 1807 cost $11.44. 26th February at 1811 cost $11.64. 19th February at 1809 cost $11.95. 13th February at 1805 cost $11.69. 12th February at 1803 cost $11.63.
450,"Uber is very convenient. Safety is a small issue but the ride sharing option helps. The price is excellent, cheaper than taxis. Much better than taxis, I avoid taking taxis as much as possible due to safety and drivers do not like to go very far. Available any time while taxis can have long wait times. A lot of drivers in my area."
451,The biggest problem I have with Uber is the difference in time from what the app shows to actually getting in the car. I use Uber in many locations. Some places don't have too many cars around. So when the app says 12 minutes but it turns into 22 minutes it messes with my scheduling. Please be more accurate with your projected time from ordering the ride to the ride showing up at meeting place.
452,"We got an Uber driver when in Orlando and he was magnificent. I tipped well, so he came back to Universal Studios and picked us up for free. Gave us his cell number. He drove safely, was courteous, and very accommodating. Answered many of our questions about Orlando as well, and Florida in general."
453,I started using Uber about a year ago. I like Uber because it convenient. It takes me to and from work. To the movies I use it when I go out. On The town. Most of the people are friendly and they are there on time. I really like Uber.
454,"I was planning on taking an Uber to Midway airport on my recent trip to Chicago. I was planning on leaving at noon. I checked what it would cost me around 11:30. I was quoted $35. 20 min later when I got down to the lobby and ordered my Uber, the price jumped to $58! I switched to Lyft which was only minimally cheaper. Next time I will leave myself more time and take the train! Very disappointed because I really enjoyed taking Uber from the airport. Never again! Taxis are cheaper!"
455,"After a long trip we took Uber from our airport to home. It was my fault that in gathering our things I left one small bag in the back seat. I have been trying to contact the driver/Uber since then. My first attempt to contact the driver was successful in reaching him BUT he promised to bring the bag over but hasn't shown up yet (48 hours). I have tried contacting him again through the Uber App, which is the only way I know to get in touch with him. No return calls yet. I then went back to the app and followed the ""can't contact the driver"" link and have reached out to Uber to become involved -- twice. No response from Uber. This is NOT what I think of when I think of customer service. The bag contains critical things like me heart/BP Medication and my passport!"
456,"UBER would not schedule a ride pickup for me because they said my bank declined the transaction. I provide 3 different bank cards with the same results. UBER stated it was my error and they wanted me to use/buy an UBER gift card for the transactions. I declined and asked them to verify what BILLING ADDRESS they assumed for my cards. They refused. When I checked with my banks, they informed me the BILLING ADDRESS that UBER used was not mine but was the ""pick-up"" address. I then went back to UBER and told them to delete my account and to start over. There has been no response in over 48 hours."
457,Drivers have the option of setting a destination and Uber is supposed to give the driver rides toward the set destination. I used this option but they sent me in the opposite direction costing me time and money. They refused to compensate me for their system error.
458,I have many charges that were done incorrectly. There is no contact number or email. I have been trying to reach out to them the last few months and to no avail. their help page is nothing worth it. I believe that such a company should be reachable at least via email. Be very mindful about charges.
459,"We booked an Uber for my husband to go to the airport this morning. No one showed up, no one even called to let us know they wouldn’t be coming. Instead we had to wake up our young children very early to get him to the airport which was what we’d been trying to avoid. Now my husband is late and may miss his flight."
460,"I have used Uber since they came to my area. The prices have skyrocketed since they first began service here. The last two times I used it, the driver was lost and driving around forever so the wait was extremely long. Besides the price hikes, I really like Uber."
461,"I was transported by Uber a few times by the VA. Sometimes they were on time, sometimes not. I only had one bad experience with them, and was a rude driver. He didn't seem to want to take me at all. I'm sure the VA paid good money to transport me, but he was just real unfriendly."
462,"My limited experience was good, having a picture of the car and driver ahead of time was nice. However, after hearing about the Uber driver that left an out of town group stranded at a gas station in an unfamiliar town then yelling political insults as he drove away horrified me. The fact that the company backed the driver makes me very hesitant to use them again."
463,"“Hi, I would like a credit for the inconvenience my colleagues and students had to go through, as well as myself. I scheduled and placed this order at 8:30pm, for delivery between 10pm-10:30pm. At 11:00pm it was still pending, so we got food for our kids from somewhere else. At 12:20am, I just received a message that the order was accepted and is being delivered. This is unacceptable, as we had to spend $120 on room service due to the fact we could not reach the restaurant or Uber Eats and our students had to eat."
464,"I have worked as Uber driver for the past few months putting a minimum of 6 hours a day and I realized the money one makes after paying for gas, maintenance, depreciation, and wear and tear is nothing more than 7.50 per hour. To be a dishwasher at a restaurant one could make far more than this. To claim they are your partner, it is true because they take 50% of the fee and contribute 0% to the expenses."
465,"While I don't use the service often, I've had excellent experiences with Uber. The taxi fare from the airport is $45 for the 17 mile trip. With Uber I've never paid more $25. And the service has been timely and very courteous."
466,"Buyer beware! Do not buy an Uber gift card. I received one as a gift, and tried to use it to take a trip with Uber. The card did not work. I have sent 25 requests to Uber customer service, and have been told 25 times that Uber cannot apply gift cards to rides and they do not issue refunds. Please do not buy an Uber gift card! Uber customer service does not help with gift card issues. The only way to contact Uber customer service is through the app. They do not have a phone number."
467,"As a rider all is somehow ok but as a driver this company is the biggest scam ever... They will use you, abuse you and throw you like a piece of trash after you get just a couple of traffic tickets, claiming on your driving record that even the non moving violations are moving violations for them... This nasty company full of thieves will steal drivers' tips and tolls and squeeze out of you and your car all they can before kicking you away..."
468,"Uber app did not connect properly from Baltimore MD Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center and then said they do not have any drivers there. Therefore I could not get an Uber to take me to Bethesda, MD. after a medical procedure. Be wary."
469,I have used it regularly especially in Europe. Found it to be quick and efficient at a fair price. Have only had one issue where language was a major issue and we were put out a mile from our destination.
470,"I have only rode with Uber a couple of times and it has been one of my worse experiences. I scheduled a pick up with a driver and before exiting his vehicle I asked if he could wait on me to pick up a few items in the store, he said no problem. He said, ""You will have to cancel my pick up and once you reschedule since I am already here the call will be directed to me."" Not knowing any better, I did as I was instructed. Well that trip turned out to be a nightmare. I schedule another driver as instructed and got two other drivers trying to get the pick up, so the first says just cancel the pick up, well guess what. Once you cancel a pick up that's an automatic charge."
471,"If I could give them a minus 10 star I would. I have used Uber in many occasions. This was by far the worst and still ongoing problem. I recently was in Denver, took Uber to airport as early morning flight. That was January 7th, I was billed $41.58 plus tip. It was originally a hold on my credit card and a charge several days later. On Feb 2nd I was notified that my Uber receipt was updated. Looked at my credit card statement online and saw an identical charge with identical trip number charged to my account almost a month later. Contacted Uber by the app which went to someone in India that claimed they had a glitch in their system and I wasn’t charged for the trip in Jan 7."
472,"Uber drivers made me feel unsafe. I had one Uber driver harass me and kept calling after the fact I cancelled the ride because he had me waiting over half an hour and then called said he drove to wrong place. Most drivers are rude and somehow there's always an issue with the app, then they don't have customer service or a number where someone can be reached if there is an issue. And when I emailed Uber about the driver making me feel unsafe since he kept calling me and harassing me, their only response was to block the driver or call law enforcement. They need to fix the app and thoroughly background check these people they hire!"
473,"On January 10th I ordered an Uber, Driver requested cash payment, I immediately left the car and contacted Uber support. 3 months later on March 24th, Uber charges me a cancellation fee for this trip. I cannot dispute the charge because 30 days past the incident they are not able to make changes. Does this mean, when Uber drivers request Cash payment, we better accept it, otherwise Uber is going to charge you the cancellation fee?"
474,"I paid $24.99 for a Ride Pass because it offers ""Weather protection"" so that you pay a consistent price for each route you take regardless of rain or time of day, or so Uber states. My route to work and back started out at $10.49 each way. After a bit Uber began charging me $4.00 more to go home from work. When the snow and cold came I was getting charged well over $20.00 one way. When I asked Uber about this they replied: ""With your Ride Pass, you'll pay a consistent price for each route you take. Periods of high demand may impact the price of your trip, but we'll always give you the lowest price."" This in itself is contradictory. How can you pay a consistent price for each route if the price can be jacked up at Uber's discretion? The claim of Weather protection and protection regardless of time of day is nothing more than a bogus promise by Uber and a way to scam you out of $24.99."
475,I have had it where an Uber driver has canceled a trip and then the payment is reversed but the next payment is a higher fee which they do not show until after the trip has ended. I have also had it where they have charged me twice for the same trip or added a penalty that should not have been there.
476,"Uber has to be one of the worst services I have ever used. Every single one of my drivers has been horrible, my card has been hacked through the app, I was charged an incredible amount for a ride I took over 7 months ago and was not able to split the fare with the people who took the ride with me and there is NO phone number for customer service. Probably because they know people will call all day to complain. I deleted my account and the app and will NEVER let my friends/family use this service again."
477,"I have used Uber less than 25 times, Holding to a schedule today, created a trip in Las Vegas. App showed car ** heading our way to Rio. Arrival 2 min. But after 2 min, app showed car weaving back and forth, after texting Driver 3 times, finally spotted driver, waved to him while standing at head of designated Uber marked line. Driver pulled close, saw me, gave a dismissive wave and drove off. Was it my wife? Maybe our two bags? I couldn’t book another ride for 15 min and my schedule was blown. This is a big gap in the Uber model, you can’t use the app to call the Driver out and the Driver gets a cancel fee! This rewards the Driver negative behavior!"
478,"Please all consumers to check your Uber charge one-two days after, as I was charged 20 times more than what I agreed for my share ride of a few blocks in NYC, without being informed or even not being aware. On 30 July 2019, I took a share ride in NYC and was dropped off six minutes later. I was sitting just behind a driver and a co-rider was next to me. Although I was not happy about the driver's pick up (he passed me few blocks), his route (deviation), and his drop off (needed to get off very busy car traffic side), I did not complain as I thought it was a short ride. "
479,"My Uber account was hacked and someone swiped $475 from my bank account. They used the Uber cash for UberEats and some rides. I contacted Uber and they agreed that since my bank card had been canceled that they would give me Uber cash credit, which I agreed to because I knew I would eventually use it. They only refunded me $225 and ignored my repeated attempts to explain that that wasn't the complete refund. After days of trying to resolve the issue, they closed my account entirely. Their ""cut"" and ""paste"" responses make no sense and now they're ignoring me entirely."
480,I use Uber when I miss the bus after work sometimes. The last two times it says a reasonable price usually about 8-10 dollars. Then after booking the ride and confirming the flash new price which has been 13-14 dollars. Then it asks if I want to pay 25 dollars to get to pay 9.99 for the ride instead of the 13-14 dollar price. This has happened 3 times now. I'm sorry but I'm not gonna pay 25 bucks so that I can pay another 10 for the ride home. That's ridiculous.
481,"Wife and I recently started driving Uber after our teenager had surgery and we had 5 figures worth of out of pocket expenses. My wife started working with Uber 3 weeks before me and she referred me. Since then, I get non-stop promotions every single week for the last 3 months. Most recently I started getting ""objectives"" bonuses based on how many customers I take in a week to get an extra bonus."
482,"Convenient for in town trips. No issues and drivers are friendly. The value is fair, I am very much happy to see women drive Uber in our country. I wish them success. Still need to try longer distanced trips. Thank you."
483,We have used Uber about 6 times and have never been disappointed. The drivers have been wonderful. All have been personable and knowledgeable of the areas we were in. I would definitely use them again.
484,"Uber is continually squeezing profit away from drivers by changing their policies. I've been driving for over a year and have a nearly perfect rating. I do a fantastic job for this company and I feel completely unappreciated. I am not alone. Every month that goes by, Uber finds ways to change their policies to be less friendly to drivers, who they call partners. They have made it clear to me more than once that I am expendable. Regardless of the service that I provide for them, they are aware that hundreds of other drivers signed up today, and if I don't like it I can leave. They're changing incentives that we have counted on and taking up to two-thirds profit in many rides. Uber needs to be held accountable and must show their appreciation and value of the drivers who are the backbone of their business."
485,"On October 16th, I reviewed my bank account and there was two charges for Uber that totaled $50. I contacted my husband to see if he knew anything about the charges and he did not. I contacted the bank and they could see that it was my husband's debit card number. Neither one of us has ever used Uber, and he is a truck-driver and was driving at the time the charges were posted. The bank said that he needed to contact Uber to dispute the charges. It is not easy to find out how to contact Uber, there are no phone numbers available, so the only way is to do everything online. I logged the dispute and was contacted by Kervin and he said he had passed it onto another department. There has been no contact since. The bank has reversed the charges, but Uber needs to be held accountable for the fraudulent charges. Very disappointed in the way Uber has handled this situated."
486,"Very good service with clean vehicles. Price was as expected. Arrival of driver was in a very rapid time frame. Courteous service. Did not have any apprehensions as to safety, reliability, or comfort."
487,"I have changed my phone number back in December 2018 but didn't try to change my phone number on my Uber app until recently. While I was able to change it on the app, I can't update the payment information. I reached out to customer service and they asked me bunch of questions like sending them screenshot of my phone number, name on the account, last ride taken, etc. "
488,"I have been punished for circumstances beyond my control. I have asked repeatedly for someone to tell me what I have done wrong or could have done differently and no one will talk to me about it. You see, I am a driver for Ubereats, and I loved it until Friday night when I had several orders not completed due to circumstances outside of my control. 2 orders could not be delivered because the restaurant wasn't serving the items at that time. "
489,I used to really like Uber and over the years only had 1 bad driver but this year I'm constantly having billing problems and having multiple extra charges above fare and tip to the point of overdrawing my bank account. Reaching customer service is a totally separate hell to go thru. I have to find an alternative because I see NO EFFORT on uber to resolve any of this.
490,"Months ago, I purchased & loaded an Uber gift card on my Uber app. It then refused to accept the gift card DEMANDING additional credit or debit card... Hi-jacking & holding the money I spent & entered on the app of their official gift card. Months later, I entered a debit card issued by MetaBank in Iowa & it refused to accept it!!! Now, after nearly 2 hours of trying to access my account data, it won't accept my password. After over an hour of trying to reset my password and receiving numerous reset codes from Uber, they still won't allow me access the account! What they're doing is personal data collection of phone number, debit & credit cards, email address & social media accounts. Who's paying them to collect personal data! Sneaky way of personal data collection & robbery at the same time."
491,Great ride to big airport in Houston at 6am. A Courteous and very safe driver picked up in Westheimer area and driven to airport before high traffic time. Will do it again in a heartbeat before driving and having to park.
492,"Ease of use is great, being able to not have money change hands and can tip online is a huge plus. The cars are clean and the drivers are respectful. Never have had to wait more than ten minutes."
493,"Uber, not the driver, double charged me for the tip I left for the driver. The tip was debited twice, on two different days. When I contacted Uber, they refused to acknowledge that this happened, even though my PayPal and bank account clearly show the deduction twice."
494,Unfair cancellation fees charged by Uber to customers. Uber is constantly harassing me with wrong cancellation fees for cabs which are getting booked far away from my pickup location where drivers refused to come. So I am charged fees for such situations.
495,"Uber deactivated my account with no reason given. My in-app Help section was inaccessible because they deactivated my account. I contacted Uber via Facebook and was assured Uber has already or would soon be emailing me. After 48 hours, I have not yet received an email from Uber to resolve my deactivated account. The only form of communication that Uber has had with me is through Facebook."
496,"Uber is easier to use than a taxi. Instead of trying to find a cab, I just ordered a Uber from my phone and the driver found me. The car was clean and the driver was courteous."
497,"It's been a frustrating last few rides with Uber. I am almost always charged double the upfront pricing shown and the last 2 times that was because my driver took a wrong exit on the highway which not only wasted my time but Uber forced me to pay almost double the upfront pricing for no fault of my own. From $32 to the final cost at $64 and they will not even issue a refund. Uber's customer service is the worst- you send them a message explaining your situation and instead of trying to understand what exactly happened, they just send automated messages. It's like dealing with a bunch of morons!! They will not even let me share this feedback on Uber's Facebook page- what a shame!!"
498,"I left my iPhone yesterday Oct. 2, 2018 in an Uber. Uber makes it impossible to retrieve item as you can't talk to a live person but must submit via phone (which I left in car) or online only to get a response 24hrs later it's been resolved. I asked for the driver to call me back and got NOTHING. Never ever use Uber again. They exploit their drivers and steal your stuff with no call back. Worst company ever and can't wait for them to fail. All I asked for was a call back from the driver which they promised and never did. Now I have to go back to Vegas without a phone and all my data."
499,"On August 9th, 2019, I was charged $16 for an Uber ride. The driver picked me up, and I decided I didn't want the ride, so I exited at the same address. They still charged me. I believe that this is fraudulent."
500,"My driver stole my phone and Uber did nothing about it. I corresponded with their help desk for a week and I only received stock emails. After they were unable to contact the driver, they stop responding to me but they have continued to let him drive under the Uber brand. BEWARE! You may be his next passenger."
501,My boyfriend and I were traveling out of town and we used Uber and the time said the eta was 7 minutes then it went to 5 minutes then stayed on 2 minutes for almost 10 minutes then all of a sudden it switches us to another driver! We had a flight to catch so we opened the Lyft app and ordered a ride. Lyft came within 4 minutes and the time was accurate. My boyfriend tried to cancel the ride and it said it would charge him $5.25!! I was shocked because 2 minutes isn’t always two minutes.. So I messaged the driver and told him we found an alternative form of transportation because we did not want to be late for our flight and told him we can not afford to pay the 5.25 and so he said he could not cancel the ride. This was even crazier to think the driver cannot cancel but our other driver cancelled on us and they are not penalized. It’s like having the customer being punished by uber despite uber's timings being all over the place and not accurate.
502,"In New York city we went from under 6000 cabs to over 136000. Most unreliable service. People are losing jobs, custody and money paid for congestion fees, congestion created by the high number of cabs on the same infrastructure we had 100 years ago. Drivers are not able to drive, shower or understanding English in most of the situations. They are always late, if they show up to pick you up, and have an attitude if you bring it up in any shape or form. Uber doesn't have a customer service as they don't care much as long as the stream of cash keeps coming in. I personally started writing to my legislators and the City Hall offices. It is outrageous and apparently out of anyone's control. They have been banned in many countries around the world, and if 130000 extra cars on the roads didn't improve anything, maybe it is time to stop this costly experiment on the taxpayers money."
503,"I paid cash on 11/21 Thanksgiving eve because I was travelling overseas and did not want to use any money from my account as I had bills planned ahead while I was away, so I took an Uber to JFK that day and it went well then about two weeks later on 12/8 I returned and again took an Uber from JFK to my home and still paid cash. Only to look in my bank account two days later and found Uber had charged me twice both journeys. They refunded me some of it and they are still holding my money. I went back and forth with them via FB messenger because of course you can never call them since they don't reveal their phone numbers to customers. I am still waiting for them to honor their word and save their reputation. I will continue to complain until they return my full amount."
504,I had a very bad experience on 2 January 2020. I booked Uber Cab to the Airport in Delhi and in a hurry left a bag which contained very important things. I called the driver in twenty minutes and he said he was far away. He was lying. Then I requested him to come to the airport and said will pay the fare. Though he said yes he didn't turn up and I waited for an hour. I even missed the flight. I called at least twenty times and he didn't receive my call. In the evening on the same day he picked up and said my bag is taken away by another passenger. He lied. I requested UBER but no help. This driver even threatened me and said he will not return my bag.
505,"The Uber driver and vehicle were as I would hope in public transportation. He took the most direct route and got me to my destination in the estimated time. My only frustration was not with Uber but rather the Sporting Venue I attended. They promoted the Uber/Lyft as a good option and a specific pick up and drop off location. However, they did not have any signage or directions to the Pickup/drop off point. I think the idea was great, execution poor. Maybe the UBER/LYFT companies could provide some signs for directions to spot to the venues."
506,"When I was first picked up by an Uber driver this car was a mess, barely ran, I was afraid. But my ride back was great. Very clean car, nice driver, car ran great. I was very impressed with the second pick up."
507,"Last night I took Uber to go from SNA to San Clemente. The fare estimate included taking a route that required tolls. However the actual ride did NOT take the toll road. This is the second time I was charged for a toll that was not used. In addition, there was a 3 cent wait charge. 3 cents is not the issue, there was no wait time involved. I waited for the car to arrive at the pick up location, traffic was non-existent all the way to SC. Does UBER arbitrarily charge things!!!! When the first ride had the toll charge, I sent an email to UBER because calling them and getting them to answer is next to impossible. Anyone else have a similar experience? JO"
508,"I was recently rear ended by an Uber driver. I wasn't a customer or using them. The driver informed me that he didn't have insurance, so I asked to take a picture of his driver's license which turned out to just be an identification card and not a license. I tried to call Uber and the automated message hung up on me. It seems like I have to download their app in order to make any complaints or inform them of the situation. I'm trying to let them know that this guy shouldn't be a driver for them."
509,"2 fraudulent trips on bank acct. Called Uber. Support only available thru app. I don't do data. Went to website. First time ever. My email was already in use. Used forgot password option 3 times. They sent LINK to reset password. I used it. Then a 4 digit code was required to complete password change. There was NO code in ANY of my emails from them. Can't sign in. Can't try to get my money back from the fraud. Bank still to investigate, but they had advised me to call Uber about it in case their investigation (claim) provided no results for me. WORST COMPANY EVER!!!"
510,I had been abroad and the cab driver had cancelled the cab. This is visible in app but I am not able to book cab. While booking get a message can't book earlier outstanding. There is no way I can reach concerned and get this sorted.
511,"I had both Lyft and Uber apps and when I needed to go somewhere, I would compare the prices on both. In doing this comparison one day, I saw that Uber was a lot cheaper that day (which almost never happens) by about $2 something. I jumped at it and booked my ride with Uber and was taken to my destination. I paid and thought that was it. THE NEXT DAY (I swear), Uber charged me an ADDITIONAL $2 something (just about identical to what the difference in prices between Uber and Lyft were for that distance)."
512,I have seen the Uber commercial where they claim to do background checks for the safety of their riders. Well I had an incident in 2011 and they hired me in 2017 let me setup my life to drive and support my child and wife and out of nowhere ran a background check and closed my account and I have a 5 star rating and I just think this is unfair and they should have taking care of this before they hired me.
513,"While in the Uber, another person threw up down their shirt (gross, but it detained the mess). The uber driver lied and said I would be charged $350 through uber and wouldn’t let me leave until I Venmoed her $200. I contacted uber where they reimbursed me $7 for the ride, however the driver was not held accountable. I know that we should’ve charged through uber but my friend was sick and I wanted to get them home quickly, and I couldn’t do that when we were locked inside an uber outside of my building. Wish that uber would have helped better with this situation."
514,Scheduled set appt for 3:00 a.m. pickup for ride to airport one week in advance. Received email confirmation. Driver did not show and you can imagine my panic as we were connecting to an international flight with a service dog. Called Uber to complain and have received nothing but the run around. Info from my app regarding the trip has been requested but it disappeared after the driver didn’t show. I don’t have access to that do you? The email Uber sends to provide that info insists you write your response “above this line or they will not respond”. I responded and with a copy of the confirmation and again received the same email with the same form letter. I wrote “above the line” and requested an email address to deal directly with customer service and again received the same form letter. Bye bye Uber. It’s Lyft for me from now on.
515,Uber opened up an Uber cash account without my authorization. Account has $91 in it and I asked them to refund it back to my credit card in file. They said they will and I will get it in 3 to 5 business days. It has been more than three weeks and I still did not get it after sending more than 8 to 10 text messages to solve the problem. UBER has a very bad customer support and they do not know what they are doing. They do not have a phone number for customers to talk and solve the problem. You can only communicate with them via text or email. They are 100 years behind providing good customer service and experience!
516,I rate Uber lower since they added per minute charges. Their appeal came from the flat fee which set them apart from taxis' services. Additionally there is no way to get a specific driver if you like riding with them.
517,"For two+ years I have asked Uber to reimburse me for daily, weekly, monthly and annual services not received by me. None of the formal complaint files provided by Uber address such matters that are routinely provided by virtually all other Business."
518,"My driver was very engaged and interested in getting me back to work from the dealership, having dropped my car off for service. He was open to my direction on a shortcut and we chatted about how he got into the business all the way to my work. He shared interesting details, was very professional, the car was clean and smelled wonderful and he offered to make any music or temperature changes I would like. It was a great ride!"
519,No humans to talk to. No email to write to. Screwed up my payment. Can’t reach anyone to help. Greenlight centers are only talking to drivers. I’ve tried for 5 hrs. I’m done. I’ll take a cab. If you want a total nervous break down then use Uber. Absolutely no way will I ever use this crazy company.
520,"After my husband and I spent 50$ on a trip in July and got a receipt for said trip I pretty much forgot about it until a few days ago (October 27th) when PayPal notified us about 50$ coming out of our account from Uber - we panicked, thought there was some kind of theft going on and an hour later got an email from Uber explaining that, somehow even though we have a receipt we didn’t pay them and 4 months later, without warning they were taking 50$ from us. I remember this money leaving my account because it was a high cost ride, but seriously at best I’m misremembering and only thinking of the official receipt I got from Uber in which case they should write off their mistake or at worst they are double charging me."
521,"I have used Uber for years and suddenly my account gets hacked and nearly £500 pounds gets taken out of my cards. After calling Uber 3 times, they said they would send my information over to the experts. 2 days later and no news. I emailed them and they basically said I need to open up a new account and give them all my details again and I said definitely no as they were not protected originally. Once giving them my email address and phone number, again they said, ""We will send your information off to the people that sort it out."" And again 2 days later no news so I had to email again. And now they are saying that I need to give them all my card details which was used, and I told them I can’t as I had to cancel it and get rid of it 'cause of them. The way they have handled this is extremely unprofessional and I will never be using Uber again."
522,"I have used Uber for a number of years. My recent experience has made me question that. I was erroneously charged a sum of money on my journey to cover the driver using airport parking and picking me up from the airport - he did not use airport parking (at least with no need to collect me) and he did not pick me up from the airport! I have raised this through tens and tens of messages going backwards and forwards to uber, but they just won't listen, keep taking the same party lines and have more or less told me to go away. I asked for the CEO's details to complain to, but they have not and will not provide me with them. The sum I was refunding is meager, but it is the principal! I am disgusted with Uber, the handling of this situation and supposed customer care."
523,I took a trip with Uber and their GPS stopped working so he had to use MY phone and the GPS from Google maps to get me to my appointment. I was late then had to reschedule my appointment which was important. I asked for a refund but they offered me 5 dollars off my next ride. I told them I wasn't going to use Uber again because this was not the first time I have had issues using their service. They refused to refund me and I am trying to find a number to contact their headquarters but it isn't available. Terrible business and I won't use them ever again!
524,"So I scheduled at 4:15 to 4:25am pick-up from Uber to go to airport. Uber driver notified at 3:50am and dispatched to my house. Driver leaves before my pick-up window, does not tell me he is waiting (neither does App) and I get charged a cancellation fee. I try a second time to locate a driver on Uber but none available and a driver also not available on Lyft. I end up with a taxi and a hefty fare charge. Uber touts that they offer a guarantee that your driver will be there during your pick-up time or they will give you a $10 credit. It took two e-mails to get Uber to reverse the cancellation fee, this happened only after they admitted that their driver left early. Poor, poor driver service and customer service. If Uber will not stand behind their guarantee then how can you trust them to pick you up on your scheduled time? I only ask for accountability and dependable service, isn't this what we are paying for..."
525,"I was driving in to the parking lot on of Mc Donald's on Flamingo and Eastern in Las Vegas, NV on 08/03/2020 and this Gray car drove in from the other side driving so fast she almost hit the front of my car. I had to slam on my brakes to prevent her from running right into me! She wasn't stopping... SHE REALLY NEEDED TO BE FIRST IN THE DRIVE THRU I GUESS SO I LET HER HAVE IT..."
526,"Over the past year I have seen the Uber app work less efficiently. Why is there no email or phone support to provide feedback to they can properly diagnose their issues. They need to properly collect their income and use it more efficiently. The fact that these executives, including Travis Kalanick, are making billions is appalling. Wouldn't they want their business to run more safely and efficiently? I guess not."
527,"Humble, Texas. September 15, 2018, I ordered a ride and was picked up by Edwin, driving a Toyota Corolla. The ride was quoted as $11.45. Later that evening, I tried to order another ride and received a message that I owed $35.00 for the previous trip. I requested a review of the fare, because the morning ride is a regular ride to Dialysis, 3 days a week and $11.45 is in the normal range. I received a message today stating that the driver reported a mess made and I was provided with 2 pictures...there is no mess shown and I know a mess was not made because I didn't have anything to make a mess with."
528,I took Uber everyday and although I'm regular customer they treated me badly and made expensive trips for me although for others are cheap so I don't recommend Uber anymore. I'd like to join cream because it is better.
529,"When I first started using Uber, they had the best prices! Now, a 10 minute ride which any other cab company who also has good mannered drivers and clean cars charges $11-$12. Uber is now asking between $18 and $25. It's not rocket science. I will be taking the cab instead. In addition, during the pandemic I placed an Uber eats order from Dunkin Donuts; coffee a sandwich and a donut, bc it was delivered by Uber eats, was almost 25! No thanks!"
530,"Thanks for ripping 60 bucks out of my bank account 4 months after the rides took place. Rides took place in June and July. 4 months later, October 27th you take money out of my account. I already paid it once."
531,They charged me a $125 transaction fee for a trip that costs $5.00. How is that even possible? This is a scam! I took a ride less than a mile and this is what I was charged. It’s unbelievable. I was way overcharged. It’s fraud!
532,An Uber driver was parked in a van with his door open waiting for a customer to come out. My son asked this driver to call 911 because there was a girl running around trying to stab him and his friends. This driver refused to call 911. Then this girl and a guy with a hoody on came up to my son and the guy stabbed my son in the neck and ran off. This Uber driver was still sitting there when this occurred. My son was on the ground holding his neck and blood was rushing out and he again asked your driver to please call 911. This Uber driver once again refused. 
533,Great idea of sharing your rides. But it is turning to taxi service which is not good. Usually good service. Convenient application. Inexpensive. Unfortunately price is going up. Can’t wait when self driving cars witbe available. Robotaxi!!!
534,Scheduled a ride to the Tampa Airport. Driver never showed up with no notice. Tried to book a ride again but web site couldn’t or wouldn’t supply a ride. Ended up having to book a regular taxi. Won’t count on Uber again!
535,"I called for a ride. A woman jumped in the car and they drove off despite me showing him that it was me who called. I was then charged for the ride. I complained and the fare was refunded. I was also charged a flat fee of $6.95, which they refuse to refund. Why would I be charged when it was the driver's error?! They have ignored my emails of course. I will NEVER use Uber again! I'll stick with cabs or Lyft."
536,"Uber has provided me and my family with a quick and easy way to get around that doesn't break the bank. I have had very few issues with Uber, the toughest part is usually when travelling internationally, trying to get picked up in multi-level airport parking structures."
537,"I like the service, it is convenient to order food. Uber has many varieties of restaurants to choose from. The food is delivered. This is a good service for busy people. It is also convenient for getting to your destination."
538,"There are too many issues with safety and abuse. After trying Uber, I just prefer the safety and predictability of a regular cab service. My driver made me uncomfortable, for the small amount extra I pay, for the amount I use a cab, I cannot justify using Uber. Maybe if I needed a cab more often I would think differently, and I do believe that companies like Uber are changing the playing field, but not for me."
539,"Uber works. I have used it in several places around the world. It is usually cheap, convenient and hassle-free. However, surge pricing can get out of hand. Also, I'm not convinced that they treat their drivers fairly."
540,Usually excellent. The one time I had a driver who went 2 hours out of the way (while I fell asleep) the charge was enormous. Uber credited me back within 2 days.
541,I had taken an Uber ride from one location to another location and they got me where I needed to go and it did help out to get me from one place to another since I needed a ride and they were nice to get me where I needed.
542,"When the service worked, it was good, and tech support responds quickly most of the time. Unfortunately, that doesn't make up for the problems I encountered. The app rejected my credit card and offered no explanation as to why. For some reason it accepted my PayPal even though it uses the very card the app had just rejected. It took days of back and forth with tech support to find out that my card ""isn't compatible with their system"", but they refused to be more specific than that and no matter how many times I asked what the exact problem was (ie my bank, the type of card, etc) all they did was rephrase the same answer over and over again with canned responses; repeatedly telling me to check w/ my bank, even after I told them I already had done so."
543,"We called a Uber, she went to wrong location and Uber making us pay for this trip because of their own Uber driver. We canceled after she never responded to my calls! We then got another driver... Crazy. I am done!!"
544,"I purchased $50.00 (paid 48.00 per their promotion) of Uber credits, i.e., Uber Cash on 2/15/19. I could not use this Uber Cash until March. My recent rides since then total $34.00, meaning I should have a balance of $16.00. But my account has a balance of only $6.00; $10.00 has gone to places unknown. There is no phone number to call on this, and the website is useless. I strongly DO NOT recommend using Uber Cash. Your money goes into a black hole."
545,"I have a FreedomPop number which Uber's system sees as a VOIP. Despite sending an email with a picture of FreedomPop's app showing otherwise and a link showing that my phone does not have a phone number in settings as the way FreedomPop works is weird they keep responding with the same message ""It looks like a VOIP"" and ""send a screenshot of the settings"" which my phone does not have."
546,"Recently bought an Uber with a few friends in Grand Rapids, MI. Once we got in his car he refused to drive us anywhere unless we gave him extra cash. My friend refused to let us give cash because she recently had been in another Uber in New York City who demanded extra cash and then kicked her out of his car. Never riding Uber again."
547,"I have used Uber several times and so far I am very happy with the company and how easy it's to set up an account. I love that they are constantly upgrading features with their company making customer feel safe about taking Uber. They arrive in a very timely manner and the drivers I have had have all been professional. I love that they add a feature that signals the drivers letting them know who you are when you are standing in a crowded area, it's no fun having your car drive past you and having to wait for them to come back around the block to try and find you."
548,"Hi sir. Last week I traveled in Uber. While at the time of booking it's shows 11 riyals, once I finished my I was shocked it shows 51 riyal. Really I was confused, because just less than 8 kilometer ride it shows 51 riyals. I liked the driver honesty. Driver told me, ""You can ask the customer care. They will solve your issue."" Worst thing they don't have customer services through phone, So I messaged this issue to the customer, From the customer service they told me I have booked hourly ride. But I am not aware about. Anyway I told to the customer I pay what I have ride on that day. Since after one week my problem has not solved. Nowadays they are not giving proper reply also.Other"
549,"When I scheduled Uber to pick me up at 6AM and take me to the airport, the instructions I received stated that the driver would arrive between 6 and 6:10, and I would be charged every minute I was late. The driver arrived at 6am, I walk out at 6:05 only to find that the driver left!!! Luckily, I had a car and there was enough time to drive to the airport and park my car. Otherwise, I would've have missed my flight!"
550,"I also went back to driving UBER after losing my job, all my information was updated and on 12/26 I received a $2.00 direct deposit. What I earn was 108.31. I'm still waiting. I haven't drove. Battery is dead in my car and I have not been able to pay my phone bill. The third party customer service those people have no clue. They're rude and honestly they're stealing our money. I am really disappointed in Uber. My situation has gotten worse. Waiting for my money."
551,"Uber keeps calling and sending ads to me to consider being a driver for them. I am a 66 year old lawyer and still very much active as a full time attorney. To my knowledge I only used them once, 5-6 years ago, to take my wife to a restaurant in NYC. It was not memorable for any reason. I would not dare step into one now after the rash of ** allegedly committed by their drivers. Same for LYFT."
552,"I reached out to Uber a couple times through their side menu ""Help"" in order to request a refund when I was overcharged for a trip. Unfortunately, it's very hard to get in touch with an agent, as they don't send emails to verify they've received the message. I had to keep checking in with the app, looking up ""Help"" and ""Messages"" to see if they'd replied. In the end, I had to get in touch with my credit card company to verify the refund. It would be much better if customers could have a more straightforward feedback channel. A call line would be even better. Seeing as how this is a multinational corporation, customers should be able to call with concerns that don't involve criminal activity."
553,"It's hard to imagine there are still people who haven't tried Uber. It's even harder to imagine people hailing taxi vans when Uber is available. Uber wins in every category: cost, safety, convenience, comfort, cleanliness, etc. Use it more while they are still burning through the venture capitalist money. Their cost will go up eventually, but the service is still going to be vastly superior to its alternatives."
554,"I called Uber for a ride from my home to my job and before I reached my destination, my upfront fare price almost doubled. I went online the same day and requested an explanation. Of course, they couldn't explained it, so they gave me my money back. A month later, the same thing happened to me. I called Uber from O'hare airport to my home, and this time, I screenshot the upfront price because at this point, I can't trust the company due to my previous experience. Sure enough, while I was already in Uber, my upfront price changed from $28.20 to $52.22. "
555,The Uber driver broke my luggage when he loaded and unloaded it into the trunk. I was trying to put the handle down to separate the luggage and he said he had a better way not separating them. When he took it out at the drop off he handed me a piece that broke and said casually “this came off.” The arena to engage the pull up handle release was broken.
556,"I scheduled Uber to pick us up at 5:55 am to take us to the airport for 8:00 am flight that boards at 7:30 am. No driver showed up. I waited until 6:30 and still no show. There was no way to call or contact Uber to find out if they are coming. I had to call a cab and start from scratch almost missing my boarding time. Never again will I trust Uber to meet my schedule and will never call them for service. Not reliable, no customer service. It was a horrible experience to start my trip depending on them."
557,"My husband and I travelled to a city in Mexico this month. The whole trip was great except one Uber trip. We took a single trip from our hotel to the beach around noon time. The trip was very smooth and took around 20 mins. It was supposed to be MXN 210(around 11 USD). A couple of hours later, on the way back to the hotel, we found out our credit card was charged for MXN 744.(38 USD) The driver faked drop off location. He changed a single trip to round trip. But actually, we took another uber back from beach to hotel around 4pm. I reported the problem via uber app. But all required boxes are in Spanish. We used translation app to figure out how to fill out the form and wrote down the details in English, including star point and time, drop off location and time, and more details."
558,"I have used Uber in a couple of cities, Boston and Las Vegas. Drivers were courteous and conscientious. Some more friendly than others, but always a good experience."
559,"Since February of 2016, I've been using Uber on behalf of the company I work for to schedule rides for our clients coming into town. I've probably spent close to $1500 in gift cards alone since then. I've never had a problem until yesterday. After two company cards, a PayPal account, and multiple attempts to pay through the app and the Mac, I could not get their system to accept a payment. I confirmed with my bank, that the issue is not the card. In fact, the bank is holding these transactions. But Uber doesn't have a record of them."
560,Scheduled pickup night before and received ride estimate. Morning of pickup was notified looking for a driver and received another ride fare estimate that was just about double the initial estimate. Luckily I was prepared to drive not knowing the reliability of UBER. Glad I did. This is like bait and switch. I cancelled and drove my fiancee to the hospital myself. There was no traffic and roads were wide open. I will never depend on UBER again. They also don't have contact with a real person available in order to resolve any problems. The only upside was that I was able to cancel the scheduled ride without any charges applied.
561,"Ordered dinner for the family. Uber app said ""Oops!"" and failed. Tried again but the app again failed. Ordered the exact same food with a different app - for less - but then Uber charged my card. All of that is fine. Uber's app was having a bad day, I get it. It was what happened next... Tried to communicate with Uber but Uber only allows communications by filling out a form with only a few choices. None of the form's options fit my scenario so I chose the closest one and described what happened."
562,Good service with rates little over charged sometimes. But worth using it for long distances and Express Pool is helpful in saving some money. Sometimes the maps are not accurate. Overall the experience is good.
563,The trip fare changes by 50% randomly up or down within seconds. They also display a message showing that your estimated fair might change because of poor network. No fare breakup provided after trip is finished. Which is against the law. See you in court.
564,I feel like Uber should be better about not taking advantage of riders. I recently took a ride from my home to the airport. I left my home at 4:30 on a Tuesday morning and paid a reasonable charge of $26.00. When I returned a week later Uber felt like they had me by “the Balls” and wanted $76.00 for the same route return. The ride there was Uber X. The ride back was economy. I call it getting taken advantage of. Get Lyft for a return option. I paid $21.00 instead of $76.00!! Talk about getting taken advantage of. ** Uber!
565,"My purse was stolen by my Uber driver. I left it in backseat around 9:30a on 2/25/19, and this guy tipped myself $27 on a $13.50 trip then did extra rides for himself using my Uber account, yep he change my pw kicking me and my daughter out of the app. How you ask, because my personal cell with app access was in his car (currently using work cell) in the purse he stole. Using my locator app I saw he went across the bridge back to NJ so it adds more proof. Then he lies to Uber rep, saying he didn’t have my bag yet when I threatened to go to the police he lies again saying he dropped it at 3 separate locations. So, if he didn’t have it as he told Uber, why claim you dropped of a bag you never had... LIES!"
566,"I was in the middle of my ride, maybe not even the middle 1/4 of the way to my destination and realized I can should switch my destination to another closer location. To edit your location, you have to click the search icon and edit your destination. Cool, However it wouldn’t let me. Inside the part where the search icon is and on top of that was a location symbol. Basically means you can’t change it. The location you picked is where you’re going. I figured this can’t be right and starting trying to get answers in why, I cannot change it. I was so furious!!! But because I selected a CHEAPER ride like Uber pool which makes total sense because it’s CHEAPER!!! But Uber won’t allow you to change it, if you selected Uber pool. Ok, I don’t get it."
567,"I have been using Uber for YEARS and use it often, I have spent THOUSANDS of dollars on Uber, I am DONE. Uber does not screen their drivers anymore, drivers are rude or don't speak English which is the primary language where I live which makes it hard to communicate if need be, they do not check into the quality of the cars and I know this because I had a friend who has never used Uber sign up to be a driver and was approved after I had been picked up by more than 1 car with no ac and/or had some type of mechanical problem. "
568,"I booked my Uber cab from Cantonment railway station to Bengaluru airport. After my ride gets started, my driver received a call from other customer for pickup. Suddenly my driver asked me to get down and book for a another cab. I ignored him and asked for the reason. Then I come to know that he is working for both OLA and UBER. The 2nd customer is from OLA request. I confirmed this from OTP option asked before started ride. Then I requested the customer to drop me first as I am already delay to my flight. Finally the driver not dropped me in the actual destination... hence I missed my flight... At last my important official meeting got canceled because of me. I am demanding from UBER at least to refund my missed flight charge 3500/-. I am not getting proper response... Feeling very bad about this... Need justice else will go to any extend to get back my loss."
569,"I use Uber app, which was recently updated, to book rides, to places. I have noticed the destination address and sometimes source address are written wrong, ie in the app. For example: if I type the below address, as destination address: “1755 N Highland Ave. Hollywood, CA 90028 United States.“ The destination text box selects the address I typed, but, in the app it is showing “1763 N highland Ave. Los Angeles CA 90028 USA“ which is not correct. And the same repeated every time the ride is booked. Looks like a database storage and fetching error. For more information like hardware and software specifications, please contact me at my contact details, I feel this as a very high priority and severity bug, which needs to be fixed. Thank you."
570,"I have been with Uber for over 5 years now and I am a frequent user for work, personal and food rides. I also am rated at 4.83/5 which should tell you that I am not one to be rude or complain about every single bit, until now. Last night I took the uber pool due to the insane surge charge but I didn’t think my experience would be horrific. I live 1.7 miles away from my pick up spot which is roughly 10 minutes at most away. It took me 30 minutes to get home. If this was traffic I could understand but it was the unreasonable amount of pick up and out of the way route that caused all of this. "
571,"I tried to tip a driver and was locked out of my account. Customer support sent me an email making all kinds of techy demands that I am unable to do on my phone. I do most of my UBER stuff on my Mac. There is no way to have a conversation and the one way edicts demanding that this, that and the other thing be done is just toooo ""Big Brother-ish"". Seriously these tech companies s--k and seem to demand that we acquiesce to their demands. They make all kinds of profits from their drivers who are contracted and their customers who have no accountability - they get rich off of us creating the parameters of the ""market!"" UBER is just another company that makes billions off the backs of the poor especially contracted workers."
572,"I booked a cab in Gurugram. After reaching my destination I paid the driver (Irfan **) through GPAY but he was so fraud and cheater that he submitted the amount less and then in my Uber app it started showing pending amount when in fact I paid in full. And this is not it, I thought that since it is the driver who lied, so when I will file the complain in my help section in Uber app, they will clear my pending amount. But guess what, their service is so pathetic that they didn't understood my problem, in fact told me that they can't do anything. They even don't have customer call service where I can call. This the way they treat their customers and encourage drivers to cheat their customers."
573,I have never experienced a worse service experience than I have had with UBER both here in the US and on my recent trip to the UK. I don't understand how a company can be allowed to do business when it treats their customers the way I was treated. I got a promotional code from Citibank AAdvantage credit card services to use a promo code so I can get credit on my first 2 rides with Uber. I had never used Uber before so I downloaded the App and proceeded to put in the promo code. I kept on getting error messages so I tried to get a customer service phone number in the US. To my surprise a company as big as Uber does not offer any phone customer service in the US. A multibillion dollar company with NO PHONE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!
574,I ordered and had to reorder my food again and pay for all food that's were not delivered to me... The delivery guy did not make a real attempt to reach me or ring my bell. And Uber customer service is very bad. No one to talk to!
575,"I will never use Uber again. Zero Customer Service! On Oct. 1, 2019, I was double charged on two credit cards for the same ride. I have attempted to resolve it with Uber numerous times, providing my name and number asking for someone to call me. However there is no way to talk to an actual person and in their opinion, all issues can be resolved by simply clicking on the 'Help' button in the app. If that's the case, then why am I here over 2 months later still waiting for my money to be refunded on one of my cards? "
576,"I have had mostly poor experiences with Uber drivers. I can't even believe how bad and how often. It seems as though Uber allows anyone to be a driver, without proper hiring process including character/mental evaluation. Some of the things that I have been subjected to from their drivers is mind blowing. I have safety concerns. It's no surprise that there have been some major horrors in the news as a result of an Uber driver. And it doesn't appear that Uber takes any action on reports, it's nearly impossible to even contact Uber!"
577,I order Uber for my friend home from party. They make little mess on floor. They charged me $150.00 for cleanup. After contact they adjusted to $80.00 charged for little spot cleaned. Your must be very be careful with Uber or uber driver.
578,"Uber has hold the full payment for already cancelled trip. They did not void the payment. Be careful when you used Google Pay to do Uber payments. If we cancel the trip, Uber will hold the full amount. They will not refund it."
579,"I ordered our meal on Mother's Day. Finally I get an update that security would not let the driver in. I texted, ""Where are you?"" He stated my job. I've explained 3 times that is not the place I entered and asked when he would be at my address 5 miles away. The driver cancelled my order and refused a refund. I contacted Door Dash for the same restaurant and they saved the day. DO NOT USE UBER EATS!"
580,I’ve been waiting a week for a check from them. I have auto payment for my bills and got charged $70 from the bank because I didn’t have the money in there for them. I called and was told it was a “glitch”. It shouldn’t take more than a week to fix. Asked to talk to a supervisor and got completely blown off. Terrible company to work with.
581,"I was rear ended and Uber support, the insurance that covers me while driving for Uber found me 100% at fault for being hit in the rear. These people are arrogant, they don't listen, and they do all they can to anger whomever it is that they are talking to in order to make you go away instead of doing the right thing."
582,This service is wonderful when you are on vacation. Leave your hotel and have transportation easily available. Drivers usually know the area. I did have one incident where the driver had no idea how to get to an address...but solved that with my own directions!
583,"My experience with UBER has been quite difficult than the majority of rating expressed. During my first trip with UBER the driver claimed his system was not working correctly and said he did not know what to charge. Being new to the process I asked him to estimate so I paid him $40.00 in cash. When I reviewed my checking account I found that his system was working and he charges me $31.74, I disputed the charges with my bank and they refunded my money. Once UBER found out they disabled my account and refused to reinstate it until the $31.74 was paid. I found out later that UBER drivers are not allowed to take cash. I told UBER the driver should be terminated due to his violation of of their own policy. This was outright fraud and my bank knew it. I advised they would not get a dime from me. So they banned me from UBER."
584,It’s a great service. It’s fast and reasonable price. I always use this service although I have a car and can drive but Uber is easier than finding parking. I always recommend it to my friends. I thank you for the service Uber provided us all the time.
585,"Driver took me to wrong destination - claiming I had entered the wrong address. I typed the address into the app, but it defaulted to another address (thanks, Uber). I paid about $12 extra and 15-20 extra minutes to get to the right place. I hate Uber. They just don't get it. LESSON LEARNED: When getting into the car, BE SURE TO CONFIRM your desired destination by exact street address with the driver. Uber's drivers simply follow the GPS in the app and won't ask to confirm. Uber's drivers are stupid automatons. No wonder Uber is on forefront of developing driverless technology... they are practically there already. The Uber app will offer several alternate destinations as you type in the destination address. If you, by chance, tap the wrong one - and don't notice - you'll wind up on wrong side of town. Uber accepts no responsibility. Be careful using its app. Be careful with Uber. They rip you off and you have no recourse."
586,"I ordered an Uber at the airport for me my boyfriend and his parents so 4 people and a couple luggages. The Uber pulled over, opened his truck and suddenly closed it and said We were too many passengers (which we weren’t) and told me to cancel the ride 'cause he wouldn’t take us and just drove off. I was really upset and cancelled as per the driver's instruction and was charged a 5$ cancellation fee. I’ve been talking back and forth with Uber customer service for 4 days now and they refuse to credit me the fee even though they admit I’m right and apologized for the bad experience. Their reasoning is that too many fare adjustments were made on my account (which were warranted 'cause I was indeed overcharged on a few trips). This completely irrelevant and a completely separate issue and they’re nickel and diming me over 5$. This makes absolutely no sense. The customer service quality has gone downhill from before."
587,"Uber has the worst customer service ever! If you lose an item in one of their vehicles - such as your phone, they require you to LOG IN ON THE APP ON YOUR PHONE to report it - doesn't make ANY SENSE. If you lost your phone you can't use the app! I tried to log in online to report lost phone in the vehicle and their support says they need me to VERIFY MY NUMBER ON MY PHONE - which is impossible if it is the item lost in the car! It is the #1 most common lost item in Uber, yet they still haven't figured out a way to easily report or get a hold of your driver after you have exited car. I tried to contact their customer service phone number and they hung up on me. Called again and had to say I was in an accident to get anyone on the phone. Never recovered phone. Do not take UBER if your personal property matters to you, as if you forget anything in vehicle they don't care and you won't get it back."
588,"Can you believe this? On 26th August I booked an Uber ride in Bangalore (car details is for Driver names Babu driving a Swift Dzire.) The driver was a pig and he made me get out of the car in the middle of the road. I even called the Police number from app and reported a complaint against the driver. Uber Representative called Rishi had the audacity to email me saying that Uber will deactivate my account as I misbehaved... Now let me get this, I a female misbehaved with an illiterate, uneducated local driver who is a male... Hmmm Uber I wish you stop services in India."
589,"I have used several ride share companies and believe it’s the best idea for travel, whether short or long distances. The drivers were always on time for pickup and drop-off to all destinations, were always polite, informative, and cordial but most importantly, I always felt safe because they were registered with a business who does background checks, would provide photos of the car and driver, accepted all forms of payment, conveniently provide their app on smart phones, and rating scale for satisfaction."
590,"I had seven fraudulent Uber transactions over three days in mid-October on my credit card. For nearly a week, I tried unsuccessfully to get Uber customer service to help. Uber was totally uncooperative. They refused to engage in the fraudulent charges someone in their system imposed on me. I had to cancel my credit card, get a new credit card and leave my credit card company to battle awful Uber. Uber buyer beware. I know I will never use their services again."
591,I had a worst experience using Uber in Delhi. They charged double the estimated fare and never gave any explanation which raised dispute between us. I strongly recommend not to use this ** app in your lifetime.
592,"The cost as a rider seems to have increased. One way to work costs $25. So it would cost $300 for a six week. Is it possible to purchase a book of passes? The drivers and service have always been great, it's just the cost of the ride."
593,The drivers are nice but Uber really needs to update their maps. The maps take the drivers in the wrong direction and customers are charged a pickup fee. This is both unfair to the drivers and to the customers. Please update the maps!
594,Trying to get support from Uber is the hardest thing in the world. Initially I spent many hours trying to find a phone number or email or something to get a hold of Uber to block my debit card on my account but eventually I did. I don't remember how so when I needed to get a hold of them to unblock my card because I was stranded and need a ride I couldn't find nobody to contact them at all. It says go to help in the app or on the website but all that is there are faq's and the answers. It's been 3 days of trying off and on to find a way to contact them but I still haven't figured it out. It's ridiculous.
595,"I left my phone while in a Uber numerous days ago. I even stayed in town for a extra day hoping they would contact me about getting my phone back. Instead I have been given the run around by their so called support team about submitting a report and following the process. When all that really needed to be done was someone pick up the phone and call the driver and I could of met him while in town to get my property returned. It has been numerous days since this has happened and numerous reports submitted and still nothing from their support team. Unfortunately, I have had to submit a insurance claim and purchase a new phone for 199.00 dollars. Peoples lives are on their phones, time efficiency is urgent in these types of matters. It is hard enough even finding someone to contact if your driver has no number under your trip, let alone them actually trying to help. I will never ride, recommend, or support anything that has to do with Uber."
596,The service has been fine in the some 20 times I have used Uber. The only problem has been with the tipping practices that are presented after the ride. Sometimes the software malfunctions and I am unable to show my appreciation to the Uber driver who gave me the ride. Thanks.
597,An Uber cancelled on me on Jan 5th. Went to order a ride on Feb 13th to find out from my bank I owed them money. I will not stop till I get my $12.90 back. Then they tell me after 30 days Uber can't do anything. I'm so MAD!
598,"I never called them; suddenly a driver called me, said I ordered a ride. I didn't. They charged me for a ride I didn't take or authorize. Then spammed me for 3 hours. Complete rip off. I will not use again."
599,"After about 20 rides last year on Uber, I have no complaints about convenience, safety or anything bad to say. I love Uber. I have gotten to all my destinations and had pleasant conversations with all the drivers."
600,"I have never had an issue with Uber in the last two years of using their service until two days ago, when I scheduled a ride the night before. Upon entering the details, a window popped up on the app indicating a Pick Up guarantee. If the driver did not show up within the window of time allotted, the passenger would be credited $10 for a future ride so long as it met the eligibility criteria. My driver exceeded the window of time and arrived later. As a result, I was late to arrive for my appointment. I wrote to customer service and requested the credit. The rep stated they would credit $5 instead. When I quoted their policy verbatim, the second rep stated they would not be paying any additional credit. 24 hours later, they still haven’t even credited the $5. It’s annoying that as a loyal user with a pretty good rating can’t even get something like this resolved, and in line with Uber’s policy."
601,"Apparently Uber EATS in Canada doesn’t give a crap about their customers. My order was so simple, yet they managed to screw it up anyways YET AGAIN. I ordered some fries, a couple of burgers and a green tea at around 1 or 2 a.m. and everything went pretty smoothly. The driver was a very nice guy and the delivery was quite speedy. I enjoyed most of my meal until I got to this disgusting, disrespectful, sorry excuse for a Junior Chicken. Apparently someone from the McDonald’s at St Clair/Victoria Park (Toronto, Ontario) thought it would be hilarious to douse my Junior Chicken with a bunch of Chili Pepper Flakes and some strange tasting sauce."
602,"I tried to do instant pay at Wawa. Called. They said I needed to update my card info. When I did that it refused to let me update because of a security issue. I called. The guy said he couldn't help me. I asked for a manager and he continued to argue with me. I had to keep telling him to put someone else on the phone. I had to hang up and call back. Got someone else. He told me I'd just have to wait 45 minutes. So I waited. Updated the card info. Went to go instant pay... Locked me out of the system again saying security issue. Called back. Got the first guy again. Great I thought. I could hear plenty of people laughing in the background. He put me on hold saying it was to pull up my info, but really it was to wait for them to quiet down. "
603,"Driver may or may not have stolen sunglasses left in car. That being said it was impossible to reach the driver in a timely fashion to see if it was possible to retrieve. May or may not be a crooked driver, but definitely poor customer service. Take Lyft."
604,"Been fighting with Uber for months now. They no longer will reply to my tickets about missing surge pricing etc. I am up to over $100 now in surge prices I have not been paid. If you report it, you get the same form letter, ""We are looking into it blah blah blah"". They will no longer reply to any messages about it. I have about another month or so driving with them until I have all my stuff paid off, then I am taking them to small claims court. I'll gladly pay $50 court fee to cost Uber money to have to defend it, and I will also win my case since I have everything documented directly from Uber driver app. Cya in court thieves."
605,"This morning I ordered a ride from Uber and was outside waiting for my ride. It kept saying he was nearby in the app (around by the food shopping plaza by my house) and it said arriving in one minute for well over five minutes. I finally get picked up and the first thing I noticed was a Subway sub on his dashboard and it smelled fresh (you know how you can tell because the scent is still super strong not as if sitting there for a while and to top it off, there's a Subway in the plaza by my house). I say to myself he better not have stopped at Subway before collecting me. And lo and behold, guess what was on my receipt? A wait time charge."
606,My ride canceled itself within like 2 seconds of booking it three times in a row and got charged every time. This happened before and I let it slide but it happened three times in a row again. Money is being stolen here and help is useless. Very hard to navigate the help page and no contact email or phone. Thieves! Going on to their competition now... Should of done it long time ago!
607,"Drivers have been very pleasant. Knowledgeable on various subjects, good conversation. Business minded people. Don't mind listening if you have a better route they can take. Always quick pick up when needed."
608,"I have attempted to set up Uber on my phone for a month now. It kept saying that my number was already registered. After multiple emails to the company explaining that I have not register my number and sending all the information they requested it never got resolved. It is a waste of time, useless customer service."
609,"Rates can be astronomical. Cancellation rates are high. Customer service support, is unhelpful, and most members are hard to understand. Supervisors are not available. Time waiting on hold is beyond substandard. Any issues take 24-48 hours to be resolved, or aren't resolved at all. Money is essentially stolen from passengers, and drivers. Any/all interactions with the company are frustrating, and negative."
610,"My daughter called for an Uber pick up and was told no driver was available. She called a few more times in hopes that a driver would become available. She was charged $510 (5x $102), but no driver ever showed. Uber refuses to refund the $$. They are insisting that the refund must come from my daughter's bank. It is illegal to be charged for rides that never came. Uber repeatedly stated that no driver was available and yet they charged her anyway!!!"
611,I love Uber. They have me as a platinum member because I use them so much and they give you 5 dollars credit after you get 500 points which is easy. They pay attention to details like I reported someone because car was not correct and they automatically refunded me and made sure I would never be paired with them again. Honestly I will always use Uber.
612,"I requested a ride for Uber to the nail salon with a stop at Starbucks on the way for 11.59. I ended up having to cancel the stop and just go straight to the nail salon. When I checked my app, the price I was charged was 17.57. So I disputed it through chat which is apparently the only way to contact them and was told the charges were valid because I had made a change. So what y’all are telling me is by shortening the ride I increased my price by almost $6? I spoke to several different people about the issue half of which either called me the wrong or had the situation incorrectly. The end result being Uber simply ignoring my last 7 messages. I am absolutely floored by the way they treat their customers."
613,"They didn’t have cars available at Bush International Airport on October 15, 2019 at 9:30 pm. Had to take a taxi. This is the second time I have experienced this, and will be my last as I will use Lyft or a taxi in the future."
614,"Worst case scenario with Uber is that they don't have customer care number available in India. I paid twice for a ride as I have booked a ride and paid via my debit card and transaction had done but Uber shows me an outstanding payment of my ride and when contacting them via email they response very slow. Plus when I finally got a call from them they said, ""We have blocked your card and to remove that send us the transaction script"" and even after sending them they said that it's not proper and after sending them one after another mail but still I don't get any reply. I am very much sure that Uber should be banned in India till they got a customer care office in India."
615,"Use Uber all the time and only a few times with issues. Canceled me once, rescheduled and guy still came on time. A lot of the drivers are certainly above the average cab driver. Clean newer cars, no smoke and speak English!"
616,"I'm a Uber customer. Have been for a while use Uber. I've had lots of problems with Uber but this by far is the worst. I caught a trip around 10:27 am December 22nd to my home. Driver was super rude. Dropped me in the middle of the street, rushed me out into moving traffic and pulled of with my purse. He ignored my calls then he answered. Assured me he had my bag and was on his way to bring it. Almost an hour past no call so I call back. He claimed he turned my purse in. When I asked him to who he never said. Just told me he don't have it, stop calling he driving and to leave him alone. So then I call Uber critical response team for help. They called this driver. After ignoring their calls he answered and said there was no purse. "
617,It would be helpful if the drivers spoke English. It makes me wonder how they got their driver's license without knowing English. I had one driver do a good job but was upset and I had no way to talk to him and find out what he wanted me to do because he didn't speak or understand English. Does Uber care about the language skills? Does Uber double check to see if the drivers have legal licenses?
618,"Think twice before using this service. The drivers are often obnoxious or have an attitude, and the cars not large enough to hold luggage if you need to go to the airport or to a cruise terminal. What good does a Honda Civic or Ford Fiesta do in that instance?? A briefcase and the trunk is full. Would be better off using my own car and going to long term parking or taking a train. Total waste of time. And if you say something, the driver gets offended and obnoxious."
619,"On Tuesday December 24, 2018 at about 5:37 am I opened the Uber app on my tablet and immediately confirmed a pick for $13.92 (pool). The car came by at about 5:39/5:40 am. Slowed down as I was approaching, sped off about a block, slowed down again and did a u-turn to the opposite side of the street. All this time I began running after it. I caught it at the stop light, opened the door and got in. He claimed he did not see me coming after him. This was strange, the street was empty, early morning and with my hands waving I was unseen? God bless there was the stop light that have him came to a complete stop."
620,"Someone from Brooklyn, NY driving a KIA hacked my Uber Driver account in the Fall of 2018, earned about $2,000 posing as me. Just be aware that there are Uber drivers picking up women and at times, children, who could not be approved for their own account for things like failing a background check for criminal activity, DUIs and drug convictions. Uber has weak cyber protection on their accounts and I am proof of this. Shame on you Uber."
621,"First and foremost there is no phone number to contact Uber. Is that legal? Second of all, I have used Uber about 20 times. Great idea but what they do not disclose is that on top of the charge that you pay when you schedule a ride they add an additional charge usually under a dollar. For WHAT? Example: I just scheduled two rides, both for a friend about 30 minutes apart. The first ride was 14.67, the second ride was 15.37. I checked my account and they charged me .40 for no apparent reason and .12 for the second ride. They do not tell you what it is for but it is an unauthorized withdrawal. Pass this information on. How long will customers allow ourselves to be ripped off? It shows how absolutely lazy we have all become to even allow these companies to continue to rob us."
622,Worst thing with UBER is that they do not have any REAL TIME SUPPORT. If anything goes wrong you have to fight with the driver and then take out time later on to sit and write a complaint and in reply all you will get are saved templates!!! I had to book and cancel six cabs back to back because driver denied destination and also denied cancelling the trip. And then the funniest thing is after all this UBER blocked from booking any more cab. It's like you go to a shop where the sales guy refuses to sell and then the Owner comes and ask you to leave because you did not buy anything. Is this BUSINESSES or MADNESS?
623,"I book cabs through Uber app a lot many times. Some experiences was good some was bad but my recent experience with Uber was just nuisance. I have to take my sister to the hospital as she was not feeling well in the evening, so I booked a cab via uber. The distance was hardly 3-5 km from my pick up location to my destination. First it took 10-15 mins to connect me with one driver when my pick up point is very near to the main highway (less than even 1 km). And 10 around cabs are always available in this area. "
624,"As a rider, I was significantly overcharged from the quoted price. The highest price shown was around $90 with a note that surge pricing may apply. My trip was from Mill Valley, CA to SFO. My driver and the car were great, though I would have appreciated the driver explaining the 5x rate, which didn't happen. I never saw the estimated charge other than the $90 quote. The ride was about 40 min. The charge was $293.45. Uber makes it next to impossible to register a complaint and as far as I can tell, all responses are computer-generated. I worked for hours to find the choice, charges did not match the quoted price. In the meantime, I used some other button to register a complaint. Uber's reply has been that the charges stand as they are. I feel totally ripped off by Uber and will not ride with them again. These charges are outrageous."
625,"I’ve been working for Uber for a week, I tried to pay out my funds, it won’t allow me to, I've called technical support and each person had a reason why I cannot get my funds. This establishment is very unprofessional. Having a conversation with the support team they will repeat the same thing over and over and no resolution. I would not recommend anyone who doesn’t have another income to drive with Uber. Terrible."
626,"Today evening around 8:50 pm, going from East coast Rd Intercontinental Chennai Mahabalipuram Resort in Chennai to EPA PACIFIC CITY APARTMENT which is 11KMs, I took Uber. Pathetic experience and worst thing I did. Driver was so damn rude and ill mannered and as the fare should have been maximum 150-200, somewhere between which is the unusual fare for this trip on. I paid RS 630+toll tax of 37 and driver telling me I owe RS 630 which was showing for my last trip from Intercontinental Resort to Airport which I didn't took! I couldn't understand WHY I was being falsely accused of having outstanding balance, nor WHY the fare should have been so much. Just 11kms. Quoted rupees more than the fare I already paid! "
627,I am very pleased with the service and the professionalism of the drivers. I am a travel nurse and I am in different states often and I use Uber and I am never disappointed with the drivers. They are courteous and on time to pick me up. I feel safe when I’m in the vehicle on a trip.
628,"The driver was young and naive looking. He was almost like a robot w/ no emotions. Every time I asked for help he would just say ""I don't know how to do that,"" or ""I'm not sure,"" JUST like the Echo Dot devices! He didn't care about where he was kicking me to the curb, didn't care that I didn't know how to use their app, didn't care that I lived. I'm SO glad I scheduled to drop off my daughter at school first, so she wasn't there to witness her scared mom, at a gas station, with no ride home. I tried to figure out how to use the app to get customer support too, but there was none! I even told the driver that I had cash on me and I can pay him. He just said ""If it's not in the app then I can't take you."" Uber driver was not customer friendly."
629,"As a driver I use the destination feature from time to time and it never sends me a ride near my destination! I've reached out to support and all they say is, ""I'll create a ticket and someone from support will get back with you."" I've yet to hear back from support. They can have it!"
630,"I booked a pickup on my train to Alpharetta Georgia and when I arrived, the trip had been cancelled and I was charged a $6.00 cancellation fee. I had a gift certificate but it was very confusing how to use it and my trip (including the unexplainable $6.00 cancellation fee) was charged to my PayPal account. There is no one to contact to straighten this out. NEVER AGAIN!!!"
631,"In July of this year I had sushi delivered to me in Mexico by UberEats, a subsidiary of Uber, on five occasions. The total cost was 1,918 pesos -- about $100 US. However, I was billed $1,919 dollars(!) on my credit card; something I discovered at the end of the month when paying my credit cards. I contacted Uber Customer Support (Uber does not provide any number to call, so all customer service work has to be through the via email messaging) and I was told that, due this was a glitch in the app and my charges would be refunded."
632,"I ride almost always with Uber because they has good prices, constantly has promotions and the most important thing is that they care for your safety. I’ve had situations with drivers that turns aggressive to other drivers or that they gets mad for requests you make them, even though that’s established within the fares, and once you contact the customer service team they immediately take notes on the matter and compensates you in any way or the other. Also, if you have an issue during your trip, they provides you with tools to get emergency assistance wherever you are."
633,It’s 90 degree outside. Driver has up plastic to protect himself from Covid. He had AC in front for himself but no AC in back. Spoke with supervisor who refused to make it right. After taking Uber everyday twice a day they refused to refund the trip.
634,"While on vacation in Europe, my wife and I were in an accident in an Uber. It was clearly the Uber driver's fault. Very nice guy, accidents happen. When contacted by Uber they said they would refund our trip, duh. What about the time spent on scene (over an hour), the emotional distress of seeing the other party carted off by ambulance and having been in this traumatic experience. I was just looking for a few credits, not a federal offense. I was told there was no way to determine the amount of compensation for this type of thing. Time to start using Lyft."
635,"The Uber system mostly works well but when there is a problem, the customer service is extremely poor. Uber overcharged me for a trip I took from Baltimore Airport to Washington DC. I have used Uber in the past to travel this route and was always charged $50-$60. I was therefore surprised when Uber charged me $169.69. When I contacted Uber by email, they refused to acknowledge the mistake and insisted that I had ordered an SUV and had been quoted the price beforehand, which is totally incorrect. I did not order an SUV. I did not need one as I was travelling alone with little luggage."
636,"The service is great! I trust my children riding with Uber. And the benefit to the community is not measurable, I’m confident the service has saved many accidents and damages to persons and property."
637,This past week I used the Uber service twice to attend a meeting at my job. Both rides from my house to the office and vice versa were two different prices than what I was initially shown before submitting the ride request. When I contacted Uber via email they stated that the prices I showed them from my bank statements weren't showing on their system. The only price they can see is the initial upfront price before I submitted the request for the ride. This is a fraudulent company and I don't recommend anybody using their services. Uber is a bunch of thieves and I believe no one is actually at the receiving end of the emails but yet just a bunch of automatic messages. Never will I be using Uber again. This company needs to be shut down.
638,"The drivers, of course drive extremely fast. To get to no-where, then they will scam you by adding extra charges to your ride. Some will even put you out. The also have some drivers with filthy and nasty vehicles. They will hire anybody."
639,I quoted Uber for my trip and cost was $14. I accepted. After trip charge was $18. When I asked their customer support they said it's booking fee!!?? I asked why booking fee charged after trip because in my understanding all fee should be included in original quote and didn't receive any answer. 4 bucks is not much from one person but think if they charge extra $4 from thousands using Uber every day. I would never again use Uber and won't recommend it to anybody.
640,"They need to treat patrons better than they do. Besides there are so many options besides them. It is so much easier to go with someone else for the same service. I have been changing my provider, and better background checks would be nice. The people seem so random."
641,Customer service sucks. You make a complaint against a driver & nothing happens. They work on a star rating but after complaints stars remain the same. I only use Uber because it’s cheaper than taxi. Also communicating with driver is difficult because English is not their native tongue. As for the app they use to travel needs some serious looking at. It takes the long way home.
642,I was given a fare of 6.31. I was billed 26.31. After I reviewed my trip my destination address totally wrong. I have been writing back and forth with them for 2 days. Now they cannot seem to get it right. I was wrongly charged again after their review. Was given a partial refund. Then they wrote me saying I will get the rest. I am still waiting. This is just a unneeded pain in the **. Horrible cust service. I will be trying Lyft.
643,"Tried multiple times to download Uber app all day yesterday and I’d enter the info it would ask and would either glitch or freeze. Finally after a few hours I actually got to the final step and went to click the arrow to set up my ride and I got yet another service error and was told to try again later. Emailed Uber and they essentially blamed my WiFi and service provider however when I was having the initial issues I had contacted both of them. Uber wanted screenshots, which I didn’t have, but was able to re-Install the app and try again and got the same “error” message. Sent off to Uber. They weren’t much help. "
644,"I've been using Uber for years with no issue. About 6 months ago I started receiving an error message saying 'something went wrong' and could get past the ride search without this error. I contacted customer service via their website form (since you can't email or call anyone to explain your situation). Uber support could not figure out the issue. After 3 weeks of back and forth with the support staff, I had them delete my account and was told I could sign-up with the same email after 30 days. I've since downloaded the app again and cannot sign up using my email or phone number as Uber says it is already in use."
645,I was quoted $6.25 for my ride and charged that. Hours after my drop off I received multiple notifications of a charge of $16.14 and $9.87 being charged to my card for my one ride. Yes 3 separate charges for one Uber express pool ride. I immediately filed a complaint which really only wasted my time and pissed me off even more. I was bounced from rep to rep and had to restate the same information over and over and OVER again. The last rep made it seem like she had resolved the issue until today when I saw a pending charge of $16.14 on my company card which is linked to my Uber account for business travel. 
646,"Worst customer service from any brand EVER. Hands down. There's no phone number to call and every time you report an issue over email, it's an absolute nightmare. You speak to 20 different people and you have to repeat yourself over and over again, only to get zero help. I had a year of fraudulent charges on my account for a ride pass subscription I never requested and Uber refused to refund me or help me in any way."
647,"Beware, when you choose Uber Express Pool because they tell you to go far to meet the driver, and the driver never lets you know he is there. They only give 2 minutes of waiting time. And then the Uber charge you a fee of $6.00 which is more than the cost of the trip. It is a scam."
648,"My wife and I are in our 70s and usually only use Uber when traveling out of our own area. Still, I'd say we've used Uber about 2 dozen times because we like to travel. All our experiences except two have been positive and those two weren't all that bad or scary just inconvenient. We flit back and forth from Uber to Lyft depending on where we are; some places tend to have more of an Uber presence, some more of a Lyft presence. Both are good values, overall."
649,"I contacted Uber to drive me approximately 3 miles to a restaurant. They did not follow their procedure as explained and instead gave me an estimate for the ride. I thought I would be charged $11.00, but was charged $19.00. On the return trip, I contacted them again and the estimate was $35.00. The driver arrived and I explained that I had not requested the ride at $35.00 but had asked him to call me. He said he is ""just the driver"" and does not quote the price. He left and charged me $23.00 and I did not even have the benefit of the drive home. In all, I was charged over $60.00 for a ride to and from and restaurant and Uber will not refund me."
650,Uber is fine unless you're trying to cancel a trip. I accidentally booked a trip. I contacted the driver and immediately within 30 seconds and he did not cancel it. I responded again 5 minutes later. The driver did not cancel. He finally told me to cancel after he arrived at my destination. The issue I have is that there's no cancellation button. I was scrolling through every area of the Uber app trying to figure out how to cancel this ride even after I contacted the driver and I could not locate anything. Upon intensive internet search trying to find an 800 number to call Uber directly and being unsuccessful I finally did an online search and was told thru a wiki article how to cancel a trip... to click on a tiny picture of the driver to access the cancel button. This is deceptive practice. I was charged $13.37 because of the driver's time because he did not cancel the ride and I had no idea or information on how to cancel it myself. 
651,"UBER USED TO BE GOOD. LAST YEAR, they started taking 40% MORE FROM DRIVERS. IN February, 2019, They are taking another 30%. Now when you go out, you make nothing with UBER. Uber is changing the customers more. And Uber is stealing and robbing their drivers blind. This criminal groups of con artist needs to be stopped."
652,"I have used Uber to get to and from places and generally have never had any issues. During certain nights, events or holidays they, as well as other companies, are known to increase the price of transport. For example, the general price to and from my house to downtown is $18 but they increased the price to $30 on New Year's of 2017-2018. That was annoying because they knew that many people would be vulnerable at 2-3 am and willing to pay that amount to get home. It was frustrating but doable, especially if you were lucky enough to find a buddy to split it with. However, this New Year's (2018-2019) Uber began adding surge charges in the beginning of events, thus I was charged about $30 to get to the event and then they had the audacity to increase the surge charge to $98 for the return trip! $98! Almost $100 to be driven 15 to 20 min. away. That is beyond ridiculous. "
653,"Launched app, was quoted $47 for the 30 mile ride home, what I expected, and what I've paid generally dozens of times. Got picked up and was later billed $133. Triple the quote. Uber says I confirmed the change. I did not, nor would I ever do so. I could have taken a limo for less than that. Dispute denied, just shut up and pay. I fired Uber, and will never use them again."
654,I’ve driven for Uber for 3 years and constant battle for them to get fares accurate or my rides disappear completely. And it’s always in their favor. And always the bigger fares. I’ve never been overpaid for a ride accidentally. Customer service is a joke. They act like idiots who can’t understand common English and only ever send a canned response. It is the most frustrating customer services I’ve ever dealt with. Uber treats drivers as though they are expendable. When they list how many miles I drove on a ride it is always less than that what I actually drove according to my GPS.
655,"I have been a customer for several years, recently purchased a new phone and no longer remembered my password and switched jobs so didn't have access/the email connected to the account no longer existed. Despite proving my identity over 10+ emails and several days and providing a new contact email, Uber has yet to reset my account. In fact, the first several emails simply copied and pasted the website's recommendation. I have deleted their app and plan on using Lyft in the future. What kind of company can't help a customer use its platform? Ridiculous."
656,"The Uber website states they have a phone numbers for customer service, (not the emergency number, or one out of Singapore), to reach someone 24-7. That is an untrue statement. They take you through several layers, click here, click there, and then back to a website that you have to sign in and create an account. NO PHONE NUMBER!"
657,"Contacted Uber via Phone app for services from address used on multiple occasions. Uber provided four locations for me to travel to be picked up for my ride! Aren't they supposed to pick me up from my location? I ran with arms full of packages to four different locations. The driver was most likely unfamiliar with area, thus the reason for the many changes. I couldn't keep up with the driver's request for different locations via foot. I finally sent a text to the driver for clarification."
658,Uber is allowing credit theft from companies like PayPal! Was hacked for 300 dollars in Uber charges that I didn't make! Shut them down for not able to verify payment from fraud! Do not use your app for paying through Uber!
659,"I just took my first Uber ever and I am EXTREMELY unhappy. My life is really rough right now and I don't have much money and I was stranded so I had to break down and order my first Uber. I was hesitant because I'm so broke but when I saw the ""Pool"" option for only $5.95 I was happy to see there was an economical option for me. Cut to being charged 22 FREAKING DOLLARS! I have no idea why the heck I was charged so much money! I thought the whole point of doing a carpool was to SAVE MONEY... but no, it cost MORE freaking money than if I had ordered a solo trip AND a couple of girls got picked up AFTER me but got dropped off FIRST which added half hour-45 mins to my trip home. "
660,I only take it when absolute necessary because I feel like the people aren't screen properly and that there's a high chance that I could be assaulted or killed by the driver.
661,"In July of this year I had a couple of trips that were paid for, but there was a third charge to my company card that can't be explained. I have reached out by e-mail but no response has been sent. This charge should not be there, and it has caused me grief trying to fix my account. There is no record of a receipt or trip. Even on my account it shows all trips, but this charge is not there. So beware that your account may get charged in error, so watch it very closely."
662,"My son and I have been using Uber for over a year now. Everything has worked fine, including using the “family” payment method under which family members can charge to the credit card in the “base” account. That was until about a month ago when my son’s attempts to get ride through the “family” method to link to my account stopped working. "
663,"I did a scheduled ride a couple of days ago for the next morning. It was move/relocation related. At the designed time of 7AM the app confirmed my scheduled request and that a drive was near. As I waited it appeared someone should be nearby. At the 30 minute late mark, it was obvious no one was showing up. I began to check everywhere for a 1-800-help line but there was none. I looked for live chat, none. I looked everywhere but nothing. It is clear that Uber does not want to be bothered by customers who are depending on their ride."
664,"I took Uber from IGT 1 to Sector 25 Noida and it shows rent of 820 approx. on Uber Premier, which looks good but when I reached my location without any stoppage driver asked me to pay 1210 rupees which is totally disappointing for me as prepaid taxi outside airport is even charging 950 rupees. But when I cross checked with my trip charges then I was shocked to see billing of 835 is showing on my app. I asked the driver to talk to Uber and check the same but he refused and asked to pay his charge as per his Uber application and write mail to Uber for the claim. I do took pictures of driver's mobile application screen and there is no transaction or reference number to track. Only amount, date, location is shown in it and same is with my trip detail in my Uber app. When trying to download receipt of this trip it's not opening as Uber Lite is not supporting this function. When trying to download Uber application it's not getting download. "
665,"I live in a small town which has typically on 3 Uber cars available which is fine. When I go to NYC, I use Uber almost exclusively because they are reliable, the app is very informative, and I can also select a large vehicle when needed as well as schedule in advance, a pick-up. I have never had an issue with Uber drivers in NYC."
666,"Well, I went to Lax from end of the el toro road which it was 54 miles and 1 hour and 8 minutes. When I called Uber to adjust the trip at the first he doesn't accept that and he said everything calculate right but when I prove that I am right he said, ""Yes you are right"" and instead of 50.17mile * 0.87per = 43.45$ 62.32 time * 0.1125= 7.01$. And also I had long pick up fee of 5.06$. So 43.45$+7.01$+5.06=(55.72$). But when they make a mistake to calculate the ride and also the support accept that on the recording line. 53.80$Miles * 0.87$ = 46.806 $ 68 minutes * 0.1125$ = 7.65 $. And also I had long pick up fee of 5.06 $. So 46.806$ *+ 7.65$ + 5.06$ =59.516 $."
667,"I’ve never used Lyft before, and the only cab company is highly ineffective. Uber, oddly enough, has attracted highly qualified, a very polite, drivers who drive Uber to earn extra money. I enjoy that scheduling a ride is simple through a smartphone application. Once Uber detects the local drivers, via GPS, it directs the closest driver who’s available and provides an estimated time to wait, and an estimated time a arrival to your destination. Uber also allows users to estimate the cost of rides in advance. Also, Uber allows the rider to tip directly from the application and also rate the driver. I’ve never had an issue with any Uber driver I’ve used. It’s more uncommon for me now, but every so often I do use Uber."
668,"This complaint is about the company Uber & their customer support, not a driver. I requested an Uber back in late October after a large fundraising Halloween party got out. My phone unfortunately died from the cold air while the driver was on their way, but I knew the car make/model and the estimated time so I waited since I know that even if a phone dies the trip still goes through. After waiting for a while in the cold, no Uber showed. I waited right out front looking into every car that showed, even asking if they were there for me, and didn't have any luck. "
669,"Earlier this year, a person accidentally (I assume) typed in my email when creating an account instead of her own. Our emails are only one letter different, so I can understand the mistake. I immediately contacted Uber to tell them that I had never signed up for an account with my email and to delete or disconnect it. I assumed that they had taken care of it, as I got no further emails from Uber. Now I try to create my own Uber account, but all of the other person's information is attached to it, and Uber's customer service just gives me the run-around, refusing to correct the problem, refusing to even UNDERSTAND the problem, and telling me to go create a new email and new account. Absolutely not! - I will NOT allow another person to use MY email address for an account. What part of this is okay? Uber is allowing another person to use MY email address for their account and refuses to correct the issue. What an incredibly lack of security!"
670,"Uber one minute gave me a quote of $50 on a ride I needed. A kind family member helped me to pay for it by purchasing an Uber gift card for me. As soon as I loaded the gift card onto my account, I brought the same ride up in app--and now, not 10 minutes later, it showed $63! Just to see if this was due to surge pricing, I tried the same ride in Lyft. It was $50--the same price Uber had quoted me before I loaded the Uber gift card."
671,"Earlier for pool pickups stop were either 2 mins walking or if driver happen to cross my location then it gives option to not to walk. BUT NOW the pickups and drop offs are on different street, it's so far, it says 10 to 12 mins walking, I am seriously what's the point of taking cabs if we have to walk like taking any bus. Moreover Uber has increased its charges and also not giving any promotion offers, earlier I used to get 50% off but no - either no promotion or 30% off which actually brings back to earlier price thereby not helping in any way."
672,Don't use Uber. I left my CA driver license in an Uber on 2/14 and have gone back and forth with Uber asking them to have their driver drop it in a mailbox. The replies from Uber Support are canned and even though they have all the information they need they have not been of any help. The DMV told me to file a police report so that is what I'm going to do. Use LYFT instead. LYFT has better rates too.
673,"After comparing Uber and Lyft prices for about a $40 ride, I choose Uber although the price was slightly higher just as a preference. Few mins after the ride was complete, I received an email with adjusted fair, which was $10 more than the upfront price. When contacted Uber, they gave all kind of excuses to not refund the upcharge by claiming a route change etc. Driver (a human) missed one turn and took the next one which probably change the total by 0.8 mile. Not my fault or indeed anyone's, as this is a common occurrence. "
674,I have used Uber two times and both rides were comfortable and the drivers were courteous and professional. I didn’t encounter any problems and would use Uber again if the need arises. I don’t have any complaints at this time.
675,"Drivers were close by every time I requested a pickup. Definitely a plus when you're kind of in a hurry. All vehicles were clean and dent free. As the drivers go each were pleasant to speak with. In general my experience was great overall. Just a little odd when deciding how much to tip, not sure how much of a tip they get from the company itself."
676,"Uber needs to understand that their cab pooling service is very time consuming for passengers. The drivers go even 1-2 kms off destination route to pick up and drop other pool riders. Kindly understand, this is very time consuming and we don't reach our destination early. Not like the fares are super-low that we have to bear this kind of torturous service. It would be awesome if Uber pool services are far more efficient, in the sense, each following pick up should not be of 5-8 mins of difference in terms of distance. In this way, more people will use pool services and add less to traffic jams. Uber should not just focus on making money but also contribute to lesser vehicles on roads which is very necessary in cities like Bangalore which is overflowing with traffic. Kindly do make an impact by bettering pool services and reducing cab fares."
677,This was the first time that I was using the Uber app. I attempted to set up a pick up for a future date to go to the airport. 5 over drivers showed up. One of them charge me a cancellation fee. One of them charge me for the trip to the airport that I never took. Once I realize that they were showing up I immediately texted the drivers and told them this was a mistake. I wanted it for a future date. They said no problem. However they still showed up and they still charge me. Do not use Uber. They are Crooks. The only reason I gave him one Stars they won't post this review unless you give them some type of rating so I gave them one star even though they deserve nothing.
678,"Always quick to confirm a ride no matter the time of day of the location making it very convenient. Use them often to and from the airport, very dependable."
679,"Uber is the worst company I have ever dealt with - ever. They constantly try to nickel and dime you with their sneaky fees and incompetent drivers are the worst in the business. They shouldn’t be allowed to charge you whatever they want and when you dispute it they do nothing but tell you, ""Hey you have a lot of disputes"" - well hello maybe it’s because you guys suck? I deleted my account and will never use them again."
680,I just had my first and last Uber experience. I downloaded the app and scheduled a ride to the Tampa airport for 5:30am. I received an email confirming my ride had been scheduled. That's the last I heard from Uber. We stood outside waiting for our ride and it never showed. My wife jumped online to order another ride that fortunately came at 6:10am. We barely made it to our flight and we have yet to find out if our bags made the flight. Lesson 1: Don't trust Uber email confirmations. Lesson 2: Uber does not want to get bad news. They make it virtually impossible to inform them of your consumer issue. Uber ruined the start of our vacation adding unnecessary stress. I will try Lyft next. Hope to have a better experience. Hope this is helpful.
681,"Driver was fine and so was ride. Experience of dealing with getting a coupon for first ride had me looking for a human being to talk to, and was amazed to find there was no one. I think they charge enough to hire customer service of some kind. I couldn't even find a human online."
682,This evening I placed an order with Swiss Chalet. Within seconds of submitting my order I realize my business address was selected instead of my home address. I hit the cancel button and my order was canceled instantly. This all happened within less than 10 seconds of confirming my order. I went back into Uber Eats and tried to select a Swiss Chalet with my home address but the restaurant did not come up. Assuming my order was canceled I went on SkipTheDishes and was able to place an order from a different location that was closer to my house. I then looked at my Uber Eats app and realized that they are not refunding my money for my order as they said the restaurant had already begun making the food. 
683,"Took a Uber ride about 8 minutes. The driver was Spanish. 3 hours later get email Uber takes $80 out of my Visa card. Apparently driver says 3 hours later I did damage. This is Uber's cleaning fee then I find out the driver was suppose to be a ** but I called, filed complaint but this is a scam all over Uber."
684,"If you need help, real support from Uber on their website, don't bother looking. It doesn't exist. No ""Contact Us"" or an email address or phone number. You do get directed to their Twitter feed where you can write in your question which is absurd on its face as I have never ever seen a company handle support in this way. And, you have to join Twitter just to do even this. I hate Twitter and find it stupid and useless which is why I used it for a few months years ago and deleted my account. And since I won't rejoin Twitter I cannot get in touch with Uber. "
685,"I recently started driving with Uber again and it’s only been a month. But somehow 4 times that I tried to do instant pay it fails. SMH. And when I calls driver support they tries to blame everyone but their selves. And this last time it failed. I’ve been waiting a week and still haven’t been paid. If you’re thinking about driving for Uber, I wouldn’t. They don’t care about the inconvenience of not paying you after you worked hard for them and they are very unprofessional."
686,"I do not have Uber in the area where I live. But I use it whenever I travel in Mexico and the US. The worst experience I've had, in my 2 years of using Uber, was in San Francisco. I waited 14 minutes for a driver who didn't show up. He somehow canceled and went elsewhere, and I found out the hard way. It was annoying, but didn't cost me anything but my time. The overwhelming majority of times I have used Uber were great. Nice drivers who showed up on time, drove safely and gave great service. Most Uber drivers go above and beyond. They are happy to give travel tips to tourists and help with luggage. I always feel safe with Uber as I have the Uber car's description and license tag, plus a picture of the driver."
687,I requested a ride from Times Square to the Statue of Liberty. The rate was $26 and supposed to take 20 mins. There was a lot of traffic so I didn't think much of the long ride until I started to notice all the cars had New Jersey plates. We were in Hoboken because our driver had obviously taken a wrong turn somewhere. To make matters worse he spoke little English so he could not explain what was going on. At one point he turned onto an entrance ramp in error and tried backing up it. When that didn't work he turned around and drove the wrong way. When we finally got to the New Jersey side of the ferry I received the final fare from Uber at $77! When I filed a complaint they said I had input the wrong address so it's my fault we ended up in New Jersey and refused to refund me the fare. Numerous emails back and forth got me nowhere so I am left having to dispute the charge with my credit card. Stay away from this scam artist company.
688,I have only had one ride experience I wish not to repeat - I love the ease of getting a ride and the efficiency of the drivers. The costs are always reasonable as well. I will definitely use Uber in my future.
689,Love the concept and it's much nicer than riding in a taxi cab with people who generally aren't all that happy to work there. This way you have a personable driver and can have a good experience. Haven't had one bad experience yet but if I did I would make it known to the company right away.
690,"I've had a really great experience with Uber as a customer. I've been lucky to have had professional, timely, and friendly drivers who easily put me at ease, and got me to my destination safely, and in a timely manner."
691,"Been driving for Uber about a year now and am very unhappy with the way they conduct business. There are so many issues that I could write all day about, but needless to say their app is flawed and their customer service is a joke. They are not consistent on how much they pay and since I have so many passengers throughout the day it's near impossible to keep track of the details of every fare. But after 2000+ passengers you start to get a sense of basically how much you'll get paid for rides taking a certain amount of time going a certain distance. Uber compensates me different amounts periodically, sometimes it will be a fair amount while other times I feel very shorted, of course I've never felt overpaid... Imagine that."
692,Cab no. **. Driver name Anil **. I booked my cab from New Delhi railway station to my home and by mistake I left my phone in cab. My driver didn't returned my phone. Moreover misbehave with me as he was having no fear of Uber or Uber policies are in favor of him only. After that I visited Uber office Gurgaon also but no one helped me there. Also I don't understand what type of system these people are following and who is supporting this system a company where customer service is not there and there is no one to complain also.
693,"I took a airport to airport from my hotel in Las WBA’s. The amount said I will be charged $14 plus some change. When the Uber arrived I informed the driver that I am taking domestic flight and want to go to domestic terminal. The driver said, ""I don’t speak English."" I kept telling him I want to go to domestic. He kept saying, ""Okay okay."" Finally when he took a turn I realized he was taking me to the international terminaI. I said, ""This is the wrong terminal."" He pulled over and pulled over his phone and asked me to talk into his phone translator. This he did after driving for 20 minutes and not listening to me. I even mentioned the name of the airline went I first enter the car. Did not understood a word of English and in spite of complaining to the Uber customer service they still charged twice as much. I will never take Uber again as they have my credit so they charged me doubled for having a driver who did not spoke a word of English in a US city."
694,Driver was on his way with our food as we could see his progress with the GPS. He decided not to come and made off with the food. $51.00 down the drain. Restaurant is no longer answering the phone and you can't speak to anyone at Uber.
695,"I requested an Uber as I usually do and the trip went very good. As soon as I reached my destination, a friend opened the door for me to help me with my Bags. I always look back to see if I forget anything, and I didn’t, and my friend didn’t see anything wrong with the seats as well. The next day I received an email stating that they are charging me for a cleaning fee of 80 Dollars. There was nothing wrong with the backseats. I tried contacting Uber support but it was worthless. Nobody answers via text and they don’t have any customer service number. After this horrible experience I don’t trust this company anymore. I will no longer be using uber services for their lack of professionalism, and the accountability of your lousy driver."
696,Do not! Trust or use this company. Uber does not care about their drivers nor the riders. I say this because 1st off. The 3rd party company that they use deny all. To whom may have any past minor traffic or minor offenses that do not concern with felons. I have no major offensive issues and felt with things to get my driver's license back. Been years! Still the 3rd party company will send Uber a red flag and deny all incoming new party meaning new applications for new drivers. They have been reported to many! Different local news agents and states. They also do not care about the drivers. Via YouTube reviews on Uber and the company. 
697,"I've been using Uber for years to take trips home from the store. It's a really convenient app for me, especially because I don't have a car. The drivers are almost always nice. I think it's been so rare for me to have a bad experience with someone. Also, probably the one feature I have not been a fan of us is seeing my customer rating, gives me a bit of anxiety. Overall it's a good service. I've almost never had to wait more than 10 minutes too. The prices have gone up but I am thinking (and hoping) this is because they will pay drivers better."
698,"ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!! The app charges you for your ride but once you're dropped off they keep charging. I had no choice but to take an Uber and again! I was charged for my ride, then a lesser amount than my ride and then again I woke up with my bank telling me I took another ride with Uber and was charged. Amazing cause IDK how I can take a ride while I'm sleeping. I've gone through this with them about 3 times already and instead of doing their job they ask me to, when they can check my ride log and compare to the charges.. I mean is this not what they are paid for?! Uber won't be paying me for an hour or 2 of my time to do it soooo.. Common sense. Or get experienced customer service employees who want to do their jobs, myself having at least 15 yrs of experience. "
699,"I decided to try Uber and get a ride from the local airport. I downloaded the app and booked my first Uber ride. I was watching my ride get closer and closer and I found out the name of the driver and type of car I was to be looking for. Once my ride arrived, I was welcomed by the driver that I was expecting except for there was another person waiting for the same Uber. I waited a long time for this Uber since it was 11 pm and snowing. Needless to say, the other person got the Uber because her name was on his phone. I even showed the guy my phone and when I ordered the ride which was before the other rider. I was livid. I ended having to find a cab and paying a ton more for a short ride to my car. I will never again support Uber or recommend Uber to anyone."
700,"Convenience, on-time performance, easy to hail a ride, competitive pricing with a regular taxicab. Helpful drivers too. App also makes it super easy to find a ride in minutes."
701,"I ordered UberPool, with 30% discount, the ride price was $5. Uber asked me if I want to walk and pay cheaper. I didn't want to walk and price got $9. I canceled and tried again, and again, from $5 (with discount) price got $9. I was trying to contact Uber - no way. I took taxi. Now I'm trying to reach Uber to get to know what to expect and why price got up - Uber has no customer service and no way to contact Uber."
702,"It looks like Uber has not been able to resolve the data breach issues they have and when confronted with evidence of a customer having unauthorized charges on her credit card from a foreign country, they choose to dismiss it and leave the burden of resolving the problem on the customer, instead of addressing and solving it, as a responsible and customer oriented company would do. Therefore, if you don't want your credit card to be used by foreign riders around the world, it looks like the best option you have as a customer is to resolve it yourself and close the Uber account (since Uber clearly won't resolve the issue)."
703,"Speaking as a driver for almost two years, as well as a customer for even longer. Uber by far has the worst customer service experiences. That is as a driver and customer. Avoid Uber at all costs, if you have an issue or report of a wrongful charge on your account, forget about it, you will never see that money again. Uber customer support does not even have a number you can call! Finding the email support line is very difficult, and once you do, you won’t get a response back or even the slightest bit helpful of a response. "
704,I joined Uber as prospective rider in case of my car failing and placed money into an account that would be drawn from for each event until expended. I then tried to delete my subscription/acct as an experiment and was told no money would be returned nor sent to a new account once I deleted existing acct.
705,"Cyber breach / Account hacked. Christmas day I started to get email alerts from my bank that I was charging to Uber. First one came in for over $100 then another for $75 and several others around $35 and up. All within an hour... When I accessed my account, I found all my data to be gone as if I needed to create a whole new account. I reached out to Uber right away (after contacting my credit card company of course) and the email exchanges have been beyond frustrating and their lack of due diligence in this matter is disappointing (not just for me, but their their own cyber protection and for those of their customers in general)."
706,"My experience with Uber has been terrible. There is no way to actually get in contact with customer service. I lost my phone in the back of one of their cars the other day. The only way to retrieve a lost item is to speak with your driver, however, my driver didn't speak a word of English. So I'm unable to communicate with him. Despite repeated emails to customer service explaining this, all I'm getting back are automatic reply email, telling me to contact the driver. Bad service. Will not use again."
707,"My automobile dealership has started using Uber to transport customers to & from the dealership's service. Fifty minutes ago, ""Steven,"" my projected Uber driver, texted me he would ""arrive in 22 min in a Honda Accord **"" [Massachusetts] and that I have only 2 minutes for the pickup. Fair enough! I waited thirty minutes outside in the cold before my dealership called and told me that the driver had since changed his mind because I was inconveniently far away. The contact ph# **, provided in the text, was a NOT CUSTOMER SERVICE line, but one that demanded an account # & country code, though it wouldn't have mattered since the window of time to enter the data was too short to be effective. I miss having ready service of a true taxi!"
708,I always felt safer or more secure with a female driver. Though I only had one guy who was bizarre I never let anyone even female drivers know I live alone. All drivers were prompt. Clean vehicles. Only one was slightly irritated because I had a few grocery bags.
709,"I’ve been using Uber for years. Then I tried to use it and there was a 7.00$ bal due. That’s impossible as it’s paid automatically so I pushed the button to pay and then it said I was deactivated. What did I do? I can’t get into my account to ask, can’t find a number to call. I have used this account for years. I’m livid!!"
710,Bought this card with 50$ value added by myself. When trying to use it there are NO giftcard pay options. If you can even get through. Taxi from now on. Expect to download multiple apps and find NO way to contact anyone about it.
711,The two drivers in Chicago left because they did not come to the pick up area. They went to the wrong street both times. We waited for 45 minutes and they charge us $5 both times for not being there. Uber is a great concept but have horrible drivers. This is the last time I ever use Uber again.
712,"Rideshare really impacts the cost of the ride, I feel it's a fantastic bargain. I am alerted beforehand of the expected arrival time of both pickup and drop-off before selecting and can easily to determine if time allows for pooling the ride. I have yet to have a bad experience."
713,"A short while ago my social media was hacked, and it expanded into many of my accounts (Uber being one of them). I then went on to delete my account but Uber has a policy of leaving the account open for 30 days after for possible reactivation. This led to the hacker reopening my account and using my credit card. I have since had to change all my cards. After trying to find a number to call (which they do not offer for riders) I emailed them to try and get my account deleted immediately. After 3-4 emails back and forth with them all they have done is ""refund my money"" (which they said was completed, to a card that is no longer valid) and mark my account for deletion in 30 days (allowing that individual to open my account at their leisure). I would not recommend this service to anyone if they value their privacy."
714,My daughter ordered Uber to take myself and my grandchildren to a meeting. The car had a very dark interior. When he stopped at light he turned on the red light although there was a sign NO RIGHT ON RED. He missed a car by inches and kept going.
715,I have had my account completely hacked to where I cannot sign in or view it. Someone spent over $1k in Uber rides on my credit and debit cards linked to the account and when I dialed the only number available (safety line) I was told I would need to wait until another department emailed me. I didn't hear anything for almost 24 hours and when I did it was a prompted message that did not help at all. It has been almost 2 days and I still have no received a phone call or any helpful support via email. This is a nightmare and the WORST customer service I have ever experienced. I am going to be filing a police report to the person who myself and the driver caught fraudulently using my account and looking into an attorney for Uber not making identity theft a priority and rectifying the situation on their end.
716,"I was on a business trip in CT and used Uber the entire time. The app is great and easy to use. The cost was a bit higher than I normally pay for a taxi. The drivers for the most part were nice, just a few words here and there but there were some that were so talkative."
717,I was coming home about 130 am from a friend's house. Sober. I was tired and quiet and the ride home was uncomfortable. The Uber driver did not talk to me and I just wanted to get home. I am in my early 40s and in great shape. I came home and about 30 minutes later I had a 150 dollar charge for urinating in car. I knew this was impossible. I emailed uber 20 xs and they gave me my money back. This has taken a huge emotional toll. He planned that entire ride to do this. That is why I was so uncomfortable. He was trying to steal from me. Literally. I don't think he should be driving and think uber needs to take him off the road. I am just devastated about it. It's like he stole it out of my wallet. This needs to stop. Just awful the world we live in sometimes.
718,"Uber has no customer service phone number. The only way you can communicate with them is by email. And it usually takes 4-5 days to get a response. My Uber account continues to be hacked even though I removed the app from my phone months ago. I am getting fraudulent charges on my credit card, but I cannot get Uber to help me. I just want them to delete my account completely so I don’t have to keep getting new credit cards."
719,"My last experience with Uber was with their scooters in Washington DC. It was an amazing experience! It's a whole new way to see the city - and it's especially fun if you do it with friends. My friends and I went from Pennsylvania Avenue all the way to the National Mall and back -we had a blast. It was affordable, convenient and definitely worth the try. Can't wait to go back to try it!"
720,"If anything goes wrong with the instant payment option, you have to have your bank account linked or you can't get paid. So if you don't have enough a bank account you're screwed and will not be paid. Their support told me this. I'm writing a review and reporting them."
721,"I am 65 years old, and I walked 7 miles yesterday 9/22/2020 from Doral Kia to Curtis pk, Miami, Fl, I was trying to get a Uber taxi and I could not. The application was asking me a verification code I was receiving but only one time and late, one has only 15 seconds to type the code but the code comes late and only one time, what kind of service is that? I do not recommend uber and wont never call uber for a taxi. Even, I contacted 6ya for help, but I needed a taxi."
722,"Thrifty way to get from place to place at a fair price. Clean vehicles and drivers. Unlike taxis, they don’t take you “for a ride” to make more money! Their routes are provided via telephone navigation."
723,"While visiting Nashville for a concert on August 25th, I scheduled an Uber ride at the quoted rate (iPhone app) of $21.**. We traveled from 5th Avenue, not far from Bridgestone Arena to the Gaylord Hotel. Upon arrival, I tipped the driver in cash, and we exited the vehicle. A few seconds later, I received a notification that I had been charged $79.72! Uber informed me that there was a ""surge charge"" (which I had never heard of) and that it is applicable, essentially when there are very few drivers available, relative to the number of riders needing rides. Supposedly, the rider is notified of the surge charge before accepting or rejecting the ride, but I wasn't. I was simply told ""$21.**"", then charged $79.72. There were plenty of taxis in the area that I could have taken with no waiting. Going forward, I'll routinely be using Uber's competitors when available, then taxis unless it's cost prohibitive, then Uber as a last resort."
724,"Beware. This company allows drivers to submit fake pictures claiming you made a mess of their cars and will charge you up to $150 extra without even giving you the common decency of a phone call. I was hit with a totally false charge and Uber initially refused to refund me. I did absolutely nothing to the driver or his vehicle yet when this claim hit my email, because Uber does absolutely nothing over the phone, they had already charged me without hearing my side for any details. Please avoid this alleged criminally designed company. They are not worth the headache and definitely not worth your hard earned money."
725,I have done delivery for this company for a couple of months and just noticed one of my fares was not paid by Uber. I have notified them 4 times and still have not paid me for the delivery. If you do delivery for this company make sure you double check each delivery to make sure you are getting paid.
726,"9/24/2019 Uber just updated its App. In the past, I was able to save between $6 to $8 per rider to share the pool, at the present with new Uber App, the company only cares to “maximize” its profit, yet disregard the benefit to the riders. I called the Uber via iPhone, and decided to save few dollars to join the pool rider. You could say it was my own doing that there was only two dollars difference between ride alone of $32.82 and pool rider of $30.84 (already added $2.71 for point to point pickup/drop). So around 14:07 Uber picked me up and drove around blocks, picked up another rider, dropped her off at Target, and picked up another passenger at MGM. I was all over places to save two dollars since Uber changed it App."
727,"I purchased a card for $20. When the PIN didn't work, there was no one to call. Do not do business with this outfit! Incredible that there was no customer service number to call. I lost my $20. Do not do business with them!"
728,"Why ask me to select photos of cars to prove that I am not a bot if I can only ever be talking to one on Uber's end? I switched carriers and got a new phone with a new number, which rendered me unable to sign into Uber, because I had no access to the previous phone number for verification codes. I learned there is only one way to reach out to Uber in such situation, through one email link on their website. I was not able to call them as they have made themselves unavailable to that for riders and I could not initiate a chat session with their support because I could not sign in at all, whether the app or the website."
729,"Uber has charged me a cancellation fee for a driver that no showed. A message popped up from him to walk to another location, one which I had no idea where it was or which direction. I was standing with two large bags at 5:45AM in the Marriott from parking lot in Washington DC. I wasn't walking anywhere! Won't be using uber any longer! Lyft is my choice from here on."
730,"I've never had a negative experience with Uber. It was the one I downloaded first while in college and the one I've continue to use these past 3 or so years. Some experiences have been better than others but in my opinion the drivers probably have had a worse experience. The rides I've enjoyed the most were the ones when myself and the driver have respected each other's privacy, acted courteously and professional. I have witnessed people trash and throw up all over a driver's car, and that's not alright. I think the thing that has begun to creep into the way I view Uber is all of its negative publicity. Why would I support an enterprise that I don't agree with? It's not like I am dependent on Uber. I can use other ridesharing apps, I can use a traditional taxi, I can even use public transportation. Despite all of this, I still use Uber but that might not always be the case."
731,"I have always been skeptical about rideshare services because of the news reports of assaults and robberies. I used this company for the first time earlier this year during a trip for a conference in Las Vegas. My first ride was excellent and was completed without a problem. My second ride was a little scary. I requested a ride but then my phone died. I was with a friend. While I was trying to recharge my phone, my friend came to me to tell me that our ride had arrived As we got in the car, I had an uneasy feeling. I started asking the driver ""who"" he was there to pick up and if he knew where we were going. He never gave me a straight answer and my friend had already told him where we were going. "
732,I could not post this without selecting an experience rating so I entered one. If I could select minus 5 stars I would. I drove Uber for over two months. I was not paid. Uber owes me over $600.00 and will not pay. When I contacted customer service they stated the money should be in my account within 72 hours. I contacted customer service when payment was not received. They stated that the banking information was not correct. Even though the banking information was already entered I added it again. Money was not received. Called customer service and they stated that the bank information was not correct. I asked to speak to a supervisor. I was told there was no supervisor. 
733,"Uber Eats cancel order without refund. @UberEats Hi friends. Don't order any food from Uber Eats. He will get your money and do not deliver your food, That is my experience and story. It can be with you and Its customer support will not resolve your problem. The delivery boy did not come at my home."
734,I had an accident with an Uber driver in Mexico City. The car that I got into had no side mirror. The Brakes were not working properly either. I almost got into an accident twice. The driver's conversation was unpleasant. Being a foreigner he was very curious to ask where I am from and what brought me to Mexico. I replied to be a tourist and thought that conversation is over. He became very rude and asked me if I came to look for a Mexican husband. I never answered and kept quiet. He took the wrong route and made several in requested stops. Having in mind it was uberX. He continued. Asked me whom I sleep with. He literally stopped the car and asked me to wait for him text someone. I asked him to let me go and take a different driver but he locked the doors and didn't allow me. 
735,"I’ve driving Uber for over 8500 trip in the last 3 years, with an overall drive rating of 4.91 and an excellent riders' reviews in my account. All the time we call the customer support team about any problems we have, they just don’t expect them to ever listen to you!! Last week I have a rider vomited and peed inside my vehicle and they refused to send me a cleaning fee. I talked to 5 different people in their driver's support team, but it seems they are ignorant and it seems Uber trained them to always provide the same answer. Even though I was doing Uber full time as a driver but never again. IF YOU GUYS REALLY WANT TO BE A SLAVES THEN YOU CAN WORK FOR THEM."
736,Both drivers were early and courteous. They were both efficient drivers and got us to our destination on time. The only objection was their route of travel. Since it was our first experience we did not know we could have told them there was a faster more direct route to our destination.
737,"Cheaper and nicer than taken cabs, have met some nice people. A lot of their drivers are very friendly and helpful. The savings alone are worth it because I don’t drink and drive and normal cab fee is $50."
738,"Uber does a good job of providing the service, but lately their fares have been going up and they now have discontinued the express pool service. The idea is to give a more affordable method of transportation, right?"
739,"You guys need to tell some of your employees to quit playing around in this app. Shouldn't have to ask someone why they aren't moving after several mins. Especially if I have to be somewhere essential, (no that doesn't mean going to stuff my face or going to some bs short distance place that I could have walked to, e.t.c, e.t.c) I have an early commute to work and I really don't have time for folks wanting to mess around. Sorry, unpopular opinion, you're on our time when we request the ride, not yours. Turn your app off if you don't want to drive people around but don't waste other's time though. Several times that this has happened and getting kind of sick of it. I have to put up with this until I get a car or believe me I wouldn't be using this."
740,"I have been using Uber for 2 years now. Seemed ok, but recently I was charged for a ride I took months ago (I remembered the amount - 20.04) so I opened the app and looked into trips I've taken and amounts billed. I also checked my Paypal account to verify and double check payments, and Wow I have random charges that do not coincide with rides, I have one account of double billing, and three separate charges for 17.84, 18.84 and 28.46 that have no rides associated with the dates. One was on Christmas day when I know I didn't use that service. I contacted Uber but have yet to hear anything. I cannot find any phone numbers, and the app is not very helpful."
741,"I have been using Uber as a rider from 2016 with a good passenger rating. Never had issues with any driver and my experience was in general good. A month ago Uber disabled my account. I reached customer support and after a few email exchanges, customer support sent me a rude (and offensive) email that I have violated the terms and conditions. I can safely say that this is truth challenged. I have no duplicate accounts, I am quiet as a rider and cooperative and never caused any issues. I asked customer support if there is a mistake and if they can lift the suspension but they ignored my request. This is no way to treat a client. Uber deals with problems because it cannot handle the vast clientele it has currently and makes mistakes, but this is no way to treat someone like this. I believe that TLC should investigate further how Uber is operating in terms of customer support, as well as monitor it much closer."
742,"So I took an Uber to the hospital for a medical procedure at 11:30 in the morning. Then that night at 11:30 at night a random man calls me to tell me he’s here to pick me up for my Uber. I said, ""No, I do not have an Uber now. I am asleep after having surgery."" The next day I see I am charged for that decline of service. I contacted Uber - they tell me they will take the charge off but it is not been taken off so far and I also have been charged twice for the original trip! I know that there is a pending and then there is a regular charge. I have one pending and two FULL charges of almost $40.00."
743,"If you want to be stranded, robbed and cold and hungry late or not even get there call Uber, horrible experiences 2 out of 5. Now put money on your acct for it to say having problem. Can't get money back. Can't get Uber. It's literally robbery and I will write 2 reviews a day until something is done about this, I'm just thankful my wife was able to arrange a way to pick up our son or he'd be cold hungry. This is the most ever a business or services absolute worse I've ever sealed with and I've dealt with bad ones before. Do not get robbed. Save your money. Do not call uber."
744,The drivers were fine. The problem was I could not speak to a live person. It was very frustrating not to be able to talk to a person. On occasion it took me over 2 hrs to book a ride. Their system went haywire.
745,Crooks when it comes to overcharging your card for rides you didn't take. Customer service is almost impossible to resolve any issues. Computer generated responses. Generic messages. Had to call my bank.
746,Have been using Uber and Uber Eats for years. I had recently used Uber and found a surcharge that had not been revealed to me until I had received my statement. I had asked for a refund without any response. I highly recommend NOT using this company. I am now a new Lyft customer.
747,I don’t like being charged a wait fee when they are not waiting on me. They pull up in right there and get in. There is no waiting on me. That fee should be shown before I tip the driver. You charge me extra for something that doesn’t happen is wrong. I would leave no tip are smaller.
748,"When I was still driving daily, I really respected the people who drove for Transportation Network Companies like Uber and Lyft. They use their car and their time as an opportunity to make extra money or be their own boss. I decided after multiple unsuccessful car repairs, to stop driving (I live within four blocks of 4 bus lines). Since having to depend on these car companies, I am less than impressed. I have waited for an Uber that never came at least once. Another time, the driver pulled up and drove off as I was looking for my mask within reach of the car (I knew the mask was in a pocket, just had to find out which one). I have ridden in more than one trip where the music selection was put on hip hop once I entered the car (just because I'm ** does not mean I listen to hip hop. I'm a classically trained pianist who listens that classical music or talk radio). "
749,I have been charged several time for wait time fees. These are fraudulent charges. The 2 charges Uber refunded and now I have another one and they will not refund. How do we get to stop charging fraudulently for a service not received?
750,They extort money from people and get away with it. For example I bought an Uber card for 40.00 and it wouldn't work. Their answer was that I owed 20.00 to them when in fact it is impossible to owe Uber anything. So money was taken from us and we could never get it back. I am not the only person that has been stolen from in this way.
751,1 hour ago I sent set for an Uber and the driver said he was outside. I was standing outside my job and he wasn't there. Then he said for me to walk to 202nd street when I was on 188 street. Really Dude?! I didn't order an uber pool. So he lied about being at the requested address and charged me 5.00. So then I sent for another uber and he said he was outside. Mind you I’m standing outside my job and he's not there so I’m trying to find out where he is and he canceled and charged me 5.00. So 10.00 spent and no uber yet. I took the city bus home. Is uber scamming us? Their drivers need to show proof they’re at the requested address before they charge us.
752,"Not only worst customer service... there is NO customer service available and NO ONE to contact. I took 3 rides on 2/1/20. My account shows 3 rides that I actually took 3 rides totaling charges $43.54 with tips. Verified in my trips on the app. My bank account is being charged a different amount of $62.23. That's $18.69 they didn't earn. The worst part is the app sucks with NO way to contact anyone for resolution. I am contacting my bank tomorrow and filing chargebacks. In addition, I'm moving my biz to Lyft from now on. It appears it's all set up, so they can screw potentially thousands of people out of small amounts they may not notice and stick in Uber's pocket. IMHO it's thievery. Filing a BBB complaint."
753,"At late night hour Uber driver after accepting my trip drops me midway in a deserted parking and threatened me as my trip was booked on online payment and he wanted cash. The follow ups with Uber and their responses have been appalling. On asking for driver contact details for registering a Police complaint they are denying it on account of privacy issue and sharing the car’s name plate, an Information that I am sharing in my every conversation and complaint. As a company #Uber is more concerned about protecting the interests of their Driver Partner but not keen in safeguarding the safety of their Customer."
754,"I have been trying to drive for Uber now for 4 weeks. The funny part is my girlfriend who is of a different ethnic background was approved within a week with my same car, my same insurance and a worse driving record. However I am getting the runaround for weeks with the same car and information and a much better driver record and I believe that I'm being treated this way because of my nationality. The customer service representatives for Uber played games and sent me multiple email links that took me back to the same page that did not help and I had to call four times in order to still not be active as a driver. I believe they give these Representatives too much power and they need to correct the situation before the situation corrects itself."
755,"I wish these rating systems would allow no stars. Unfortunately I have to give (one) just to submit this review. I don’t use Uber that often and the few times that I have it’s a 50/50 experience on the car you get and the person driving between ok service and a train wreck. Recently I used the app to get a car and it seemed the app was having difficulty or I was just not navigating properly and pressing the wrong buttons, who the heck knows but finally I got a car."
756,"I usually don't use Uber but I went away and had no one to take me. I had a Uber gift card but not enough money for both ways. Instead of using the balance on the gift card and charging the rest to my regular card, they did not bother to charge my gift card. They refuse to give me a refund. Customer service is the absolute worst because there is absolutely no number to call. It is by email only. This company is ridiculous and I would find another company to use."
757,"We have used Uber in many places in Europe and Canada. We have had a couple of inconveniences, but nothing really to report. We look forward to some sort of rideshare program coming to Vancouver, hopefully soon."
758,"I would give zero stars if I could. My friend from Canada bought me a gift card, I asked UBER customer service how to use it and they assured me that if it didn't apply to my order that my card would be refunded. Paid their overpriced everything for one meal and now I'm out $40+ American dollars and they say that since my Uber gift card was purchased with Canadian dollars my friend is now out of $100 Canadian dollars. I now have a gift card I can't even use and they refuse to respond to me about how I can send my friend back the gift card so he can at least use it. These people are awful and their customer service is severely incompetent."
759,I have only used this occasionally in a few cities and each time the experience was well worth it. The description of the car and the estimate of cost were both great. The cars were clean and modern and the driver was courteous.
760,"I was disappointed 600cc mini van as XL vehicle but let's forget about it. I took the expressway from Kaduwela to Kerawalapitiya and without exiting we took the express highway to Katunayake (Airport). The toll charges were 150 and 100 respectively and the driver took cash from me and I didn't know that toll charges will be deducted from my credit card. When came home after a meeting, I noticed that I was charged 750 as toll charges on my card. I complained to Uber that I need a refund of 250 paid to the driver and additionally charged amount of another 250. They credited 250 saying it is exceptional case and refuse to pay anything else. 250 is not big amount for me but they must be cheating other customers similarly. Now they have stopped responding to my messages from support@uber.com."
761,Their price is too high compared to Lyft so I stopped using Uber. I had scheduled times to be picked up early for work and still was late because the app kept switching drivers and I scheduled the ride for the next morning so I had to actually get a Uber a hour before I have to get to work to be there on time.
762,"I am a Uber user and I really love using this application especially when you go home late night. Recently, my friends and I went to a house party. We took Uber to get home, we were little tipsy at that time. I was sitting in front of the car and after five minutes I told to driver that he needs to pull over because I was going to throw up. He eventually pull over the car and I clearly puked outside, the flow of our travel was smooth, the driver was fine. However, the fare was also fine when we got home. Few days later, Uber sent me an email that the driver charged me $80 for vomiting inside his car. I called Uber service to complain but they did not solve my problem. Ever since that happened, I became more careful using this application. Furthermore, I do not have any bad intentions for the Uber company. I am just here to share my experience with Uber to inform other users that they may encounter this kind of scenario."
763,"I use Uber very often for my family members and myself included. I am impressed so far and would continue to use this service. It is very cost effective, considering I don't think it's enough sometimes for the drivers. I've only had one bad experience with my driver speeding and got pulled over and given a ticket but he fixed it by making it right for me and giving me a free ride. So I am still very much happy with Uber."
764,"Took an Uber pool. The driver barely spoke English, but me stuck in traffic, told me it would be another 40 minutes to get to my destination, told me (in his limited English) that I could get out immediately and was charged $45 instead of $10. Got nowhere with customer support. Will pursue all my options to make sure nobody else has this experience."
765,When you call for a ride and your driver is driving a white Camry... Which white Camry? Where is the driver waiting specifically? Missed more than one Uber ride because of these problems. Otherwise love the service.
766,"The vehicles were all clean over our recent trip to Washington DC. The drivers were all kind and friendly... Overall, it was a much nicer experience than the cab rides."
767,"Uber is lifesaver in the greater DC metro area. Bethesda, Rockville area travel has become much better. I think Uber has benefited businesses along Rockville Pike. Now I can Uber and go to various restaurants and stores along the pike without having to wait inordinate amount of time for a cab or bus. And the drivers are always polite. I think free wifi along the greater DC area would be especially useful for businesses along the pike to invest in. This way tourists with no data plans can benefit from Uber and travel along the many stores and restaurants in that area."
768,"I ordered an Uber ride today going from Lafayette Street and Worth Street in lower Manhattan and going to New York Pennsylvania Station. I was instructed to meet the driver at the corner. After waiting for some time my mobile phone alerted me that the driver canceled. I then ordered another car and it said that the car would arrive in 8 minutes. After waiting about 20 minutes there was ""NO CALL and NO SHOW"". I found myself having to take the subway of which I was trying to avoid. "
769,"They never showed up for the taxis we booked, they cancelled them and then charged me each time £6 cancellation fee. My clients were 45 minutes late as a result of me having to keep rebooking taxis with them. As a result I lost a large contract, as well as them trying to continually take payments from my account until my bank stopped all payments. When I complained about this issue I have have had no resolution and they still owe me a significant amount of money. We will never use them ever again. Trust your local taxi firms instead to turn up and not rip you off."
770,"I had an airport flight today. Uber would not accept my credit card, my Venmo, or my PayPal. As a last resort I brought an Uber gift card to cover my ride to the airport. I’ll be damned the Uber App wouldn’t even accept their own gift card. My daughter downloaded three of her cards to her app to buy me a ride and sure enough they wouldn’t accept her cards either. As a last resort she brought me a ride from Lift with no problem. I’m sending Uber back their gift card certified mail and demanding a refund. After much stress I barely made my flight. I’m also deleting Uber’s App and will never, ever use them again. Laura"
771,"My daughter used Uber services to take a ride to her destination in Philadelphia. After exiting the car and crossing the street, the Uber driver hit her with the car knocking her to the ground. Once she got up, the Uber driver returned to her car and drove away, leaving my daughter standing at the curb. Unacceptable. Highly recommend not using over services. Only reason I am giving this one star is because it will not let me proceed with this comment without giving it at least 1 star."
772,"Sketchy minivan came to pick up my mom and me up in a dark, isolated place where they never would have known there were people waiting for an Uber. A large good looking ** man (about 35-40ish) that had the likeness of an '80s rapper got out of the front seat, sat in the back and motioned for us to get in. The driver, a Pacific Island or Asian descent man (about 40-45ish, or more) who had the likeness of the guy from Fantasy Island looked nothing like the photo of the driver in the app and didn't respond to the mentioned name. Wrong car. Set up like a ride share in the Maryland Baltimore area. Driver not the driver in the photo in the app. Driver did not respond to his name or know my name. What the heck, Uber?!"
773,I am a new driver with Uber and had the rug pulled out from me today. Out of the blue with no warning I was deactivated for not having a vehicle inspection. I fulfilled all requirements 27 days ago and nothing was ever communicated to me this was required. After spending 4 hours on the phone with “support “ I spoke with 3 customer service representatives and 1 manager. Only 1 representative spoke intelligible English. I got conflicting information from their “support team” and caught them in several lies. If you are considering rideshare with this company you will make more money at a minimum wage job and less hassles.
774,No customer service. Incorrect instructions with no real aim as told. No phone number. App is pathetically useless although described as nothing as was. Useless app. No way to gain offer offered. It was THE WORST.
775,"I used to be so happy with Uber until I got a ** driver who decided to scam me by taking a massive detour for some extra bucks even though he was aware at what time my flight was leaving. I was in the car with my baby girl in the car seat trapped on this traffic jammed highway asking him to please stay on route because I needed to catch my plane. Him giving me one ** story after another and keeps driving . By massive detour I mean a ride that usually even with heavy traffic takes an hour max. With his scheme it took me 2,5 hours."
776,"On Saturday February 9th me and 3 of my friends were trying to get a ride back to our hotel from a concert. We were canceled on 3 different times and stuck out in the cold because the bar we were at was closing and kicking people out. We downloaded Lyft and got a ride right away. I will NEVER use Uber every again. I would NEVER recommend it to anyone. From here on out I will be riding with Lyft. Thanks for the awful experience! And to top it all off they charged ME a cancellation fee! HA! I'm not the one that cancelled! And they don't have a customer service line to call to discuss the issue, so my only other option is to let everyone else know!"
777,Their service was quick efficient and easy to use. When my car reaches the end of its lifetime I will switch completely to this new system. I think this is why car companies are running into difficulties selling cars.
778,"My daughter and I use Uber frequently and loved it. Lately I've noticed that drivers are charging a ""surcharge"" and ""wait"" charge on EVERY trip I've made without my knowledge. The numbers on the mailbox on the road and house are clear and can be read from any direction but yet you continue to park and wait across the street where no one can see you. Yesterday I went grocery shopping and needed picked up. I was charged .75 wait because I had to load my groceries and my child into the vehicle... Nonsense. And a 2.25 surcharge for who knows what. I'm done being a customer. You've lost my business."
779,"I usually take the bus or train to the airport but Thursday morning Uber Express Pool cost only $5 more than my usual bus or train so I decided to go for that. First thing is that Express Pool seems to make you wait 5 minutes before connecting you with a driver. When it did connect me after 5 minutes it told me to walk a block to a nearby corner and the driver would be there in 4 minutes. 4 minutes became 9 minutes, then 11, then 16 and it became clear from the map that the driver was heading to the airport without me. "
780,"I needed to grab a ride in pouring rain for 3-4 blocks. I'd been given a code for discount ride that was never credited. Then found another charge of $40 on my card. When I made a complaint their answer was I had made a mess requiring cleaning. First off there is no way I'd made a mess with 1 small bag and just sitting there. And if I got seat wet, well it's pouring rain! I could of gotten entire car cleaned for that much. I'm handicapped and on a fixed income. This extra fee causes a hardship and actually takes food from my table. I've used this company for years and have had good and bad but this is robbing me and taking advantage of a trust with my bank info. Company cannot be trusted."
781,"I’ve been an Uber driver for over two years and despite my one star rating there are a lot of things I love about driving for Uber, and none of them have to do with the actual company. The things I like for instance meeting new people and seeing new sites have to do with industry itself and the fact that most people are generally nice. "
782,"Uber is punctual, effective and affordable. My go to when I need a ride and don't want to pay the cost of taxi fare. I would highly recommend to anyone in need of a ride."
783,"Today I left my cell phone in the Uber. Every avenue I have taken to try to contact Uber has led to a dead end. I need the verification code sent to my phone in order to login from my desktop. But I do not have my phone. So I cannot get the verification code. There is a page purportedly just for resolving this issue. But it no longer works. I emailed customer service for help getting into my account and at 12 hours later, I have not had a response. I emailed them all day, actually. I called the only number available. That number is for drivers. There are no telephone numbers for riders unless you have the app on your phone. But I don't have my phone. The lady on the driver line promised to help me, then she put me on hold for 40 minutes. So I finally hung up. While I was on the driver line, I heard all the things Uber is doing for their drivers, as a ""driver centric company."" They do not care about the consumer at all. This is wrong. Just plain wrong."
784,"I completed a trip and didn't get a receipt. There's no support number and when I went to online help, it didn't understand my question, no matter how I worded it. So I guess I'm just screwed. Thanks, Uber!"
785,"Web booked Uber today to take us from Reagan Airport in Washington, DC to our home in Chevy Chase, MD, a trip that usually takes 30 to 45 minutes. Uber knows our address well. It routinely picks us up there and returns us there. From the airport, however, the driver set out upon roads we had never seen. We assumed he was avoiding congestion or knew a route to our home that we did not. After nearly an hour we noticed that we were navigating Hyattsville, MD, which is about an hour west of Chevy Chase. We opened Google maps, and he used that, along with shortcuts we suggested to our home. What might have been a one-hour trip home, in view of rush hour traffic then, took at least two. The driver was patient and courteous, and the fault might have been Uber’s navigation system, not his."
786,"I was quoted $16-$20 for my ride. I waited almost 5 minutes for them to match me with a driver. It was only then when nearby drivers started a bidding war with me. Drivers near me were requesting as much as $60 for a 6 mile drive. I denied them all. Until a driver was willing to take me for the quoted price. Going back home, same thing... A local driver had the audacity to ask for $78!! I was eventually re-quoted for $40-45. I was appalled!! I chose Lyft instead. And Uber had the audacity of charging me $20 for a ride I NEVER accepted. I am disputing with credit card company. Uber you SUCK!"
787,"Uber is a great business idea, in theory. Employ ambitious people willing to provide a cheap taxi service using their own vehicles for those brave souls willing to get into a stranger's messy car with the expectation of getting to their destination alive and in one piece for an agreeable price. Less costly than a limo, and far better than collecting returnable cans and bottles from the roadside for those seeking easy cash income. Win-win, right? Not so fast. Without delving into the obvious, the possibility of slipping into the back seat of a serial killer or the rolling annex of a hoarder's hovel, allow me to address the drivers here, who have only recently been permitted to receive and expect a TIP from their passengers, in addition to their 70% share of the cost of an Uber ride from their (yes, brave) fares."
788,"Most of the drivers were not friendly, will drop you off in a unsafe area don’t care, they go on to the next customer. Most of the drivers are not very good drivers. In NY they make you walk to find them. If you are visiting it’s hard to know where you are going. They will wait on you for a few seconds then leave. Uber service in MO is horrible at the airport, you have to walk with your luggage for a long ways. Also the Uber cost in DC was the same as the taxi."
789,"Uber quoted a price of $13.51 for a trip. After they dropped me off, they automatically charged my credit card $19.61. I contacted Uber customer support and they told me too bad! I called my credit card company and disputed the $6.10 over charge. They credited me $6.10 and now Uber says I owe them $19.61 and will not let me use their service until I overpay again. Honestly, it's not the money, it's that they extorted money from me and their customer service doesn't care about the customer! I'll use LYFT instead!"
790,"I was quoted $12 for a 2.8-mile ride that took 11 min and was charged 27.63 on a Saturday night at 10:30 pm. This was their charges: Base Fare $2.10, Time $4.56, Distance $3.30, Normal Fare $9.96, 2nd person $9.96, Waiting Time $ .86, Booking Fee $1.85, Tip $5.00. In what universe? Crooks. Criminals."
791,"I signed up for a ride and UBER sent the driver to the destination not the pick up point. So the driver came all the way back to get me as he said it was UBER'S fault and that this happens every once in a while. Then they charged me for all the time the driver spent both ways, I sent in a complaint and they told me basically, ""Too bad sorry we can not credit you."" They charged me nearly 3 times what the original quote was. Thanks for reading this."
792,"I downloaded the app in Charleston and didn't even get to use it before it locked me out and wouldn't let me use either mobile number to create another account. Absolutely rubbish, terrible customer service. I couldn't even delete my account as it wouldn't let me. They kept referring me to emails the support team had sent but I never received them. Totally disgraceful company."
793,"I needed to update my info in the app and it would not let me. I submitted a request to Uber and they refused to update my information saying they wanted my driver's license for proof of identity. They said in an automated email I have multiple accounts and I do not. They claim I'm a driver, which I am not. I have only ever been a rider. Now I have zero access to use the app and they refuse to communicate with me except through auto emails. I called the customer service line and the system tells me I'm not authorized to use the line because I'm not a premium user. This is BS. Horrible company and even worse customer service."
794,"I had my pay locked up 3 times, after jumping thru Uber's hoops. I am back online for food delivery. I am told I can no longer use instant pay. So the day comes for them to deposit my weekly pay in my account and they have it locked up again with a written statement saying I have to wait another week for my pay! I bet no one has had to wait 2 weeks for their Uber pay. I can not seem to get this resolved. "
795,"I use Uber service at least 20 times a month, I was charged for an additional stop that I did not take, when I contacted the help website they were less than helpful. I received a response “the driver’s additional stop was justified”, and I in turn was charged the additional amount. So, I asked 3 times for a refund for the money that I added to my account for future trips that I would be taking, and I never received a response. As a matter of fact the Help Desk kept pinging me without a response. This is not the first time that this has happened, but it’s the first time that my money was not refunded; it's the same address every time that Uber adds to my trip."
796,"It is such a convenience and safety is a definite. They are very professional and they just make things a whole lot easier. They also have like discounts at times. App is great, timing is great. Their prices are just right and fair."
797,I booked a Uber on 24/12/19. At the time of booking the amount was 390/- but at the time of payment they fluctuate on rate and it shows 625/-. I don't understand what kind of service are you providing to the customers. This is such a pathetic service. Even when I was trying to call on 2-3 customer care numbers its says this is not valid or it was switched off. You guys have a ridiculous services. I will never recommend uber to anyone. You guys are excellent in making a fool of customers. Heads off to you uber team. Dear all who is going to book uber in future please dont book it. Use Ola and other option.
798,"Opened account and gave credit card details. Got confirmation from Uber, ordered Uber for following day. 10 minutes before Uber due received message that ride was cancelled and account closed. No explanation. Left stranded. Contacted them via email then told account has been restored with no explanation. NOT GOOD ENOUGH UBER."
799,"Evidently, the ride-pass that I purchased expired after a month(?); the purported discount was never applied to my account, & it automatically renewed making Uber the most expensive ride option for me. For the consumer, Uber has erected obstacles to obtaining assistance. I will dispute the charges and delete the app."
800,Needed to use it to go to a running store for a Packet Pickup... driver very courteous and good driver on the freeways and to find the place. It only took a couple minutes to get my packet and he agreed to stay and return me to my hotel where I got the pickup from. I was pleased with the service he provided and gave him a nice tip. There was no other potential way for me to get to the Packet Pickup unless I used a taxi and I'm positive that would have cost quite a bit more. Place was about 30 minutes away.
801,"I have had some very positive experiences with Uber, but two experiences were terrible. The first bad experience I had was a driver criticized me for not being able to drive myself. The second happened this morning (1/6/19). I had ordered an Uber at 7:02 a.m. and saw that the driver was only six minutes away which would've been more than enough time to get me to work at 7:30. I kept an eye on my Uber app to see how close the driver was and noticed at 7:10 they were about a block away. I waited in front of my house for 22 minutes and when I saw they hadn't moved since 7:10 I was forced to cancel my ride and call a taxi. Not only was I 15 minutes late to my job, but I was also charged a cancelation fee."
802,"Uber as a concept is great! I use them to get to and from work until I can get a car again. Around 2 years now I've been using them religiously. However the last 9 months I have noticed a huge decline in accessibility, longer wait times by 10 fold, price surges constantly. I'm not sure why they would lay off more and more drivers when there are already struggles to catch a ride as is now. I'll schedule a ride 12 hours in advance and still get the good old ""sorry we couldn't find you an uber"" message. Average time til I can find a uber anymore is 1 and a half hours every time. Get it together Uber!"
803,"I have a disability which limits my walking. I can't drive due to severe nerve damage and uncontrollable reflexes. The closest store to me is a Family Dollar which is .02 miles from my house. The cost for me to Uber there is $6.50-$7.50. Along with all other companies promising cheaper pricing to make conveniences more affordable is yet another lie. After putting Taxi Cab Services out of business, rates skyrocketed. I can't say how so very disappointed I am with Uber. I have an upcoming surgery which I pray will be a success. I would love to be an advocate for anyone having to utilize transportation services due to no available bus routes so they may travel when needed at a fair price. I use to take Uber to work, the last two years I've paid a private driver to transport me to work, which is cheaper than Uber (12.4) miles 5 days a week. I haven't been able to work in the last 27 days and would appreciate the use of affordable transportation."
804,"Uber is ""generally"" quick, reliable, and safe. Only had 1 driver with strong smell of marijuana in the car- put me on guard of being pulled over by police. Otherwise, drivers I've encounter were courteous and cognizant of their safety as well as mine by introducing themselves and calling me by name. I always check the license plate before entering the automobile."
805,The Uber app has the help option but only accommodates a number of preset problem configurations and absolutely nothing outside of it. I had an issue where I was grossly overcharged for a ride. Now there was construction in the area but the driver admitted that he was completely unfamiliar with the area and therefore his lack of knowledge was the more significant reason for my delay.
806,"Me and some friends called Uber to pick us up for an event. I paid 13.00 for my ride to the event and my friends paid 26.00. Once the event was over we went on the Uber app to schedule a pickup. To our surprise the price tripled. My fare went up to 45.00 and their price went up to nearly 100.00. The company was truly ripping us off. I guess they thought we had no choice but to pay them because we used them to drop us off. However, we ended up walking about 1/2 mile to see if the price would go down and it kept going up. I called Lyft and paid a much lower price. I will never use Uber again."
807,I had charges for an UBER trip on my credit card. I have never used UBER and I have no UBER account or app. UBER is not even available in my rural area. When you go to the UBER website or phone number there is no way to challenge the charge or get information on the trip it was used for. The help site requires you to sign in to your account. I never had one at UBER. They defraud you and so far I have had to cancel my credit card with the false charge and after more than 3 weeks the charge is still on my account. UBER has no support for false charges unless you have an account with them. They are making money fraudulently.
808,and 2 ways to determine who the person is should be shared between the driver and customer. This way there is a face just in case something goes wrong.
809,"I was visiting DC and am not familiar with the city. I had been doing tour sites for work and ended up near my hotel having dinner with co-workers. I did not realize how close I was to my hotel but because it was late, as a woman I did not want to walk alone so I ordered an Uber. The driver was going to take full advantage of me. He was charging me $14... I accepted it because I thought I was probably far from my hotel. When he started to drive, and as we approached the traffic light at the end of the street (the restaurant was located in the middle of that street) I recognized the Walgreens and Starbucks on the corner and realized the restaurant I had been eating at was not even a 1/4 of a block away."
810,I used Uber while I was on a trip in California. They are a great company that I would recommend anyone to use for their transportation service. They got me to my destinations safely and were friendly to me. I like the ride-sharing service too to help save on cost.
811,I've spent hours trying to register on the app. The support team hasn't been helpful. At this point I want compensation for the time invested in it. But of course these cheapskates won't pay out unless forced to.
812,"I was a first time user yesterday, using a Samsung 7 Android and the Uber app, which was set up a week ago, in order to establish an account. It was around 6 pm and needed a ride to the hospital, was attempting to schedule a 6:30 am pickup the following morning. The app appeared to provide a 'Clock' to schedule, which I used, but prior to confirming there was no indication that the time would be 6:30 am. Thinking it was a screen update issue, proceeded and the time reflected 12:50. There is no way to edit, so I cancelled immediately and tried again, paying careful attention and again I ended up with 12:50, so cancelled that and had my Daughter add me to the 'Family' option, which worked out from her end."
813,Uber is convenient and fast. Cheaper than yellow cab. The platform has changed though with the nearby location pickup which is confusing at times because the location might be a couple of blocks from where you requested and the drop off time is near where you want to go even though after drop off the car drives past the location of drop off. Overall the rideshare company is great.
814,While making a return trip home from Knoxville Tennessee to Maryville Tennessee my cell phone went dead. The driver pulled over and told us we had to get out. This is BS. Be sure your phone is charged. This is a true and actual statement it happened to me and my wife. We made the driver take us back to Market Square where he had picked us up. I refuse to get out of the car with my wife in the middle of nowhere. Funny how I taxi service didn't care if my phone was dead or not. Never again I will wait on a taxi. You travel with whoever at your own risk.
815,"Some of the rides were great, some were awful. One car had no A/C, another car had a seat full of crumbs that I had to sit in, another car had all the seats slashed, another was not the car I asked for, but a very high Chevy Truck I could not get into. I had to go inside the doctor's office, where I had just left, to get a stool so I could climb into the truck. The Uber driver refused to cancel as he would be penalized, and I refused to cancel for the same reason. To end the stalemate, I was lucky the doctor's office had a stool. Uber is great for when you need a ride and are unable to drive for medical or other reasons. However, Uber does not seem to have any consensus control over the cars people are driving. Out of all the rides I needed, 50% were great and 50% were awful. I am thankful I am able to drive again."
816,"I have used Uber in Portland, OR, Houston and Norfolk, VA. I have found the service to be good. My best rides are when the driver gets out to find me. Sometimes at busy airports it is hard to find your Uber especially at night. The texting for the driver helps also. It was always appreciated when the driver took the luggage to the door."
817,I have been riding Uber premier cars for the past 2-years in various Indian cities. What I have seen is that the 100% of Indian Uber drivers as all the other taxi drivers in the country do not close their windows and use air-conditioning or heater (in winter) when they are not on a trip with their riders. The Uber drivers thus maintain a filthy interior with dusts of all kinds on all the cars along with mosquitoes freely 'roaming' inside the cars. 
818,Ordered a meal that never arrived. Uber Eats took the money from my account. After contacting Uber Eats they said they would refund the money to my account. The money was never refunded. Do not trust this company!!!!
819,"Uber's customer service department is absolute GARBAGE! All I needed was help changing my password because someone had hacked my account. They wanted information like my social security #, which I was not going to provide. There is no # to call them unless you pay for a premium membership - so I went to their chat support. 7 representatives came into the chat and left immediately without resolving my simple request! Or giving instructions on how to change my ** password! Lyft will have my business from here forward."
820,I drove a cab for over 10 years. I think you're doing the community a great service and understand the payment of what you're doing. People that NEVER drove a cab or service alike don't understand. Those are the people that needs to go back to work doing something else and leave this type of business. They're trying to ruin what decent service we have for the community. Those that want to strike are probably the ones that destroyed the cab business. Keep doing what you're doing. You can't make everybody happy. That's life!!
821,"I have been waiting for my $19.85 since February 7th! I have called your customer service office SEVERAL TIMES only to get the runaround. My last time calling was yesterday and I was told that the money would be in my account today, IT IS NOT IN MY ACCOUNT!!! The issue started on February 7th, when I tried to cash out via instant pay. For whatever reason, the money did not go to my bank. I was told that the amount would be deposited into my account during the following weekly deposit. It wasn’t. I am sick of calling your customer service representatives, that apparently have no clue of what they are doing and do not have access to real information. I would just like to receive my money that I am owed without getting the runaround and generic excuses!!"
822,"I used Uber for the first time and the estimated fare was 27-36, being cheaper than Lyft I went ahead and did it then they charged my card 77$ and only gave me 19$ back. I will never do business again with these people."
823,"When I had to go to work, it showed that the ride would be $8.24. So I agreed, when I finally got in the Uber after waiting for over 20 mins, I seen on my screen that I am being charged 20.41! So I am livid because I did not have 20.41 to have someone drive me 15 mins! The drive took back streets and did not follow the route. I tried calling and emailing Uber with no response. I would like a credit for the amount that was originally appeared on my acct."
824,"I have been Uber Driver both Rider and Uber Eats Deliver with 4.8 ratings and over four thousands ride. Reached Platinum status as I have always given my best effort and services. Two months ago, I got ticket for Reckless driving however I was not that speeding. Court lower the violation into Disobeying Highway sign as Minor charges on record. It's more than 2 months past, been to Uber green hub station twice, they upload my court document. But still didn't heard anything from them. Upon calling Uber Support, I was asked to Upload Court document AGAIN. It's weeks passed and again nothing update so far. "
825,"I have used them in the past while traveling to and from the mainland. After all I have heard and read in the news, I will no longer trust these services. As a senior, I worry they will beat me up and rob me."
826,"I've been doing Uber Eats part time now for over a year. This complaint is about Support, payment of promotions. You will get promos via text message. This last week I decided to take them up on a 3.00 extra charge for each delivery between 11 AM and 2 PM on Sunday Jan 20th. The text reads ""Uber Eats: Today earn an extra 3.00 for every delivery completed between 11 AM and 2 PM "" I got out there at 11 AM and received 4 delivery notices, I completed them, and ended my deliveries at 1:15 as no more calls for my services were needed. I went home and calculated my fees and was short 12.00 for the promotions."
827,"We broke down in West Columbia, S.C. and had to get a hotel waiting for repairs. My wife downloaded UBER (we have never used it prior to this). A nice, polite man picked us up promptly and we were very happy with the $10.65 fare. After renting a car and returning home I find all sorts of charges (from Calif.), including one for $6,45 and a $99.99 TIP!~ Of course there is no way to talk to anyone at UBER and so far they have done nothing but ""Promise"" to correct it. We will never use them again and advise others to stay away!"
828,"Scheduled an Uber ride 2 days in advance to get to my airline flight at the airport. When the time approached, the app said to be prepared because pick up would occur at the scheduled time. I stood out in the rain with my bags waiting for the driver. No one showed. The app changed from pick up at the appointed time to pick up ""soon."" After 40 minutes of panicking and trying to contact Uber, I gave up and contacted a taxi company that fortunately was able to pick me up and get me to the airport in time for my flight. The taxi company was small and the owner picked me up himself otherwise I would have lost all the money for my airline tickets and prepaid hotel reservations."
829,"Customer service on the part of Uber completely sucks. Had problems requesting a ride twice that system errored, got locked out of my account because of your errors. Went through help to unlock it and it errored twice. Again same EXACT problem. Tried help again. ZERO response from customer service the second time even after following your prompts online. Bad for business when people are trying to use the service first time on vacation. Ended up having to use taxi service. It's over 12 hours later and STILL no response from Uber. Hope they end up out of business. Will certainly be reporting poor ratings anywhere & everywhere I can including BBB & state attorney general."
830,"Whenever I book a bike or cab from Uber they never came in location from which I have booked the cab. They always go somewhere else, the problem with uber is picking up the location. Its app picks up the wrong location and the drivers goes somewhere else, then I need to help drivers to get my location. So here is the incident: yesterday (10 Aug 2018) I booked a Uber bike and I put my drop location, the same location I always puts whether it’s uber or Ola and before reaching the exact location the driver says, ""This is the location you have put and I will not go beyond this location,"" I told him that, ""You will need to go from another side. This street is closed to get my place,"" he denied to go. I told him, ""If you drop me on my location then you will be paid otherwise no payment."" "
831,I took Uber for the first time last month. My wife and I were at the Tokyo Airport and had many bags. We would have had to wait a few hours for a base bus on standby. The vehicle was large and extremely comfortable. We got home before the standby bus departed airport. The cost was a bit high at $500 but was for a two hour commute.
832,"Used Uber MANY times. Car is always clean - much better than taxicabs which are typically more disgusting than the restroom of a bus station. Also, getting the ride is much more reliable. No phone call to a dispatcher and waiting an hour or more. You can watch the car on your phone as it approaches."
833,"Booked 22 hours in advance no one showed up. Bad as that was, support and help department said: ""We're sorry to hear that your driver canceled your trip and that this delayed getting you to your destination. I can confirm that no cancellation fee was charged on this trip request. If you were referring to a different trip, please let us know."" Well that was nice of them. Then (obviously a form letter since I did not pay anything): ""We understand your concern. We know this is not the news you were hoping to hear, but we will not be able to refund this fare due to it not being within our standards. Thank you."" So, Uber has no policy if no one shows up after an advance booking? Won't be doing that again. Lyft next time."
834,"Total scam company that uses, abuses, and cheats their drivers in any way possible! Treat their drivers like garbage with worst online help imaginable! Will change stats in the background to avoid giving you discounts without you being able to see them or know what happened! Would show surge/bonus areas only to have disappear when one block away at prime time they should be there! Kept me at 84% acceptance rate, 1 below needed amount even though I accepted 100% of what I received without showing how or why! Lyft way better in every way!!"
835,"This was the worst experience I have ever had. Customer service was horrendous, and my issue was NEVER resolved. If you can avoid ever using these two companies that would be the best option for you. Go bank and Uber support are filled with people who do not know what they are doing. All I wanted to do was set up my Uber Visa Debit Card for rewards and it turned into 7 hours on the phone between both companies, I can't tell you how many ""disconnected"" (hung up on) calls I had. AVOID AVOID AVOID."
836,I have been driving Uber from 26th Dec 2018 and it's been almost 5 weeks but Uber hasn't paid my money. Uber owe me almost $6000 now and I have called their customer support several times but they just don't seems to care. They keep sending me system generated email and ask me to update my account detail which I have done so many times. I drive Uber full time so this issue had put me through severe mental stress and financial crisis. Now I have an appointment with lawyer next week to see what can be done. I am surprised that company like Uber have no proper procedure in place to resolve this important issues. Uber should be banned or asked to review their payment procedure so people like me don't suffer.
837,"First, I picked UBER POOL as it was 40.00 cheaper than just UBER. I was given 89.00 for my complete fare on the app.. Which told me that was it. Didn't press anything else. THIS WAS THE COMPLETE PRICE THAT UBER put on my cell phone. The next day, I got a charge of 109.98, on my credit card. Plus I gave the driver cash tip. I DIDN'T approve any tip. They put an extra tip charge in addition to the 109.98. I was told that because I didn't take a picture of the day of service price, that it's my word against theirs. Basically calling me a liar. They now have a surcharge of LAX 4.50, 2.50 FOR PICK UP. Fee upon fee. Should have taken a taxi."
838,"Uber charged me $23 for a 15 mile trip. In less than one hour I utilized the sevice again to go back to where I came from (15 miles). Uber charged me $53 for the exact same trip I just paid $23 for. The driver said to call customer service. There's no number to call. The online support responded that I was not over charged when clearly I was. To make matters worse you can only choose from pre selected issues, none of which addresses the real issue at hand."
839,"My husband and I went to the Taylor Swift concert in Nashville TN last night, August 25, 2018. Our Uber experiences have always been great until early this morning when trying to get back to our hotel. I don’t understand how it cost roughly $26 to get from our hotel to the Nissan Stadium and $185 to get back to our hotel after the show. That is price gouging and it’s illegal! We paid it to get back to our hotel because that was our only option, but that kind of money is needed for the house payment! I am extremely disappointed in Uber! I understand the demand for a ride was high, however 5.7 times higher is unacceptable!"
840,"Depending on the location you can get a wide range of Customer service when it comes to drivers. My experience has basically been a good one. Places like San Diego seem to have a lot nicer more laid back attitude, mostly students making money. Other places like downtown Los Angeles and most airports have unfriendly drivers where they let you know, they are just there to drive, no help with luggage, no chit chat."
841,The driver drove too fast and reckless. Would not slow down. Stated she had to drop me off so she wouldn’t be late to pick up her kids. It was not my fault she arrived late. She said she was getting her hair cut and that is why she was late.
